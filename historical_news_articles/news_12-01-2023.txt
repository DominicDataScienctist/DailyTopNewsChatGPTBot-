content:TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says it attacked more than 400 targets throughout Gaza in the 24 hours since the end of a week-long cease-fire with Hamas sparked a resumption of combat operations.The Israel Defense Forces released In a statement, the IDF said that air force fighter jets had struck more than 50 targets around Khan Younis, a city in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.The heavy bombardment and ground operations across Gaza killed nearly 200 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more in the first day of resumed fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The temporary truce Israel has notified at least five Israeli families that their loved ones taken hostage by Hamas are no longer alive. More than 100 others remain in captivity, according to Israel's military.A United Nations official tells NPR that about 50 aid trucks managed to enter Gaza via a border crossing with Egypt and were waiting to be unloaded Saturday morning. However, the vehicles did not reach Gaza's hardest-hit north. The number of trucks delivering aid on Friday was also far fewer than the around 200 per day during the week-long pause in fighting — a number that relief officials have said is far too small to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.2 million people.Even so, a senior official of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the cease-fire "offered a glimpse of what can happen when the guns fall silent.""We need to maintain – and build on – the progress in aid delivery," Martin Griffiths, OCHA's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said. "We need civilians and the life-sustaining infrastructure they rely on to be protected. We need the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. We need a humanitarian ceasefire. We need the fighting to stop."Amid what international groups have described as a growing humanitarian crisis in besieged Gaza, Israel says it will not renew the visa of the top U.N. aid official for the Palestinian territories.Nearly three years ago, Canadian-born Lynn Hastings was named deputy special envoy for the Middle East peace process and the resident coordinator for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.But a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Friday that the U.N. had been informed by Israeli authorities "that they would not renew the visa of Miss Hastings past its due date at some point later this month," according to In a statement to NPR, Israel's foreign ministry confirmed that Hastings' visa would not be renewed. Citing what it calls the U.N.'s "one-sided and biased attitude" in the conflict in Gaza, the foreign ministry said it had decided "not to automatically approve the granting of visas to U.N. representatives in Israel and to examine each case individually."

tile: EPA aims to slash the oil industry's climate-warming methane pollution
topic type: Climate
written by: By Jeff Brady
date: 12/02/2023
content:The oil industry has long leaked methane into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse gasses that are warming the planet. Now, new federal rules aim to dramatically reduce that pollution in the next 15 years. The Biden administration has issued strict new regulations to reduce methane from oil and gas industry operations. The announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency comes as world leaders are in Dubai for the annual United Nations climate meeting, where Methane is the main ingredient in natural gas. It stays in the atmosphere for a shorter time than carbon dioxide – the most abundant greenhouse gas from humans. But methane is a EPA Administrator Michael Regan, in a written statement, called the new final rule an "historic action to reduce climate pollution, protecting people and the planet." He said the regulation is part of President Biden's ambitious climate change efforts, to zero out the country's greenhouse gasses by 2050 and meet goals in the landmark Paris climate agreement. The EPA estimates the new rule will reduce methane emissions nearly 80% below what they were projected to be, and that will "prevent an estimated 58 million tons of methane emissions from 2024 to 2038." The agency says that's the equivalent climate warming power "as all the carbon dioxide emitted by the power sector in 2021."The EPA says over that period, the amount of methane that will be captured or leaks avoided, would be enough to heat nearly 8 million American homes for a winter.The agency also estimates the final rule will have net financial benefits of at least $7.3 billion a year from 2024 - 2038. Included in that accounting is the cost of deploying new technologies, along with climate savings and health benefits.Human-caused methane emissions are responsible for about 30% of global warming today, according to the Included in the new rule is a "Super Emitter Program" that allows third parties, including environmental groups, to detect and report large methane releases from oil and gas sites. The EPA says studies show these large emitters account for almost half the methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. There's also a requirement for the industry to phase out routine natural gas flaring at new oil wells. Often drillers will flare, or burn, gas that comes out of the ground with more valuable oil when there isn't a pipeline nearby to transport the gas to buyers.The new rule also requires "comprehensive monitoring" for methane leaks from well sites and compressor stations. In addition to regularly inspecting sites, the EPA says oil and gas companies will have to choose "low-cost and innovative methane monitoring technologies" to detect leaks.And the rule creates standards for reducing emissions from equipment, such as controllers, pumps and storage tanks. Some states already have methane emissions programs. They will now have two years to submit them to EPA for approval to ensure they comply with the new federal regulation. "With other countries also zeroing in on methane as a key climate risk, it's a signal to operators worldwide that clean-up time is here," said Fred Krupp, Environmental Defense Fund president in a statement. EDF is among groups that have established methane monitoring programs, including plans to Even though the new rules are aimed at the oil industry, they're getting praise from some larger companies. "BP welcomes the finalization of a federal methane rule for new, modified and – for the first time – existing sources," Orlando Alvarez, chairman and president of BP America said in a statement.But smaller companies have been critical, fearing increased costs that could make some wells unprofitable.The industry's largest trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, says it's still reviewing the final rule. Earlier this year, API detailed its concerns in A senior EPA official says the agency made changes based on such comments. The official says now the EPA will certify groups with methane monitoring expertise, assess reports of releases for accuracy and then notify a responsible company of the release so they can fix it.It's not yet clear whether that will satisfy API's concerns but the comments highlight something many people involved in this rulemaking process assume: the new regulations will likely be challenged in court.

tile: Liz Cheney is back and unloading on the current leaders of her ancestral GOP
topic type: Politics
written by: By Ron Elving
date: 12/02/2023
content:Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ousted by a hard-right revolt within his own party this fall, said this week he will be "taking this time now" to think about his political future. The California deadline for filing for his seat is Dec. 8.Now comes Liz Cheney, a former member of McCarthy's own Republican leadership team, to give McCarthy some food for thought. He is not likely to find it palatable.Cheney has written a book about President Trump's efforts to remain in office after he had lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. The book, It will be officially out next week, but got an early preview when CNN obtained a copy independently and published excerpts this week, ahead of an embargo. The excerpts have produced headlines across news outlets, primarily for Cheney's treatment of McCarthy and other former colleagues.Cheney says McCarthy was guilty of "cowardice" in his unwillingness to stand up to Trump, according to the excerpts. She says McCarthy had told her he knew Biden had won the election and she even reports that Trump himself had told McCarthy he knew it too.And yet, Cheney notes, according to the excerpts, McCarthy went on TV denying that Biden had won. Moreover, in the hours immediately after the riot that breached the Capitol on January 6, McCarthy spoke on the House floor calling the violence "unacceptable, undemocratic and un-American" — yet he also joined with his party members who voted against certifying the electors from some of the states Biden had won.  Without the votes of those states, no candidate would have had a majority in the Electoral College. That would have triggered a "contingent election," with the winner chosen by a vote of the House. Trump's allies thought they could win such a vote because it is taken as a roll call of the states: just one vote per state, regardless of a state's population or number of seats. Efforts to carry out that plan have since produced federal charges against Trump for his role in the January 6While Trump surely remains the central villain of Cheney's narrative and analysis, the CNN excerpts also include scathing criticism of Republicans generally. She calls them "enablers and collaborators" who fell in line with Trump's false claims. And she singles out both McCarthy and his still-freshly minted successor Mike Johnson of Louisiana for sharp condemnation.She reports, according to the excerpts, that she was shocked that McCarthy went to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to reconcile with him three weeks after the Capitol attack.  The excerpts have her protesting to McCarthy with: "Mar-a-Lago, Kevin? What the hell?"  Cheney reports  McCarthy replied that Trump's staff had asked him to come because the former president "wasn't eating" and was "very depressed."Cheney's treatment of Johnson, McCarthy's successor, in the excerpts is relatively dismissive by comparison. She notes that she was House Republican Conference Chair when Johnson was first elected to a lower rung of the party leadership and they worked together.But Cheney unloads on Johnson in the excerpts for his role in an Despite objections from Cheney and others, most Republican members of the House did sign that brief, including McCarthy. But the Supreme Court still declined to hear the case.While Johnson was aggressively gathering signatures from his colleagues, according to the excerpts, Cheney overheard one of them say in exasperation: "The things we do for 'Orange Jesus.' " In the excerpts, Cheney names the congressman, who has since denied using those terms for the former president.In fact, the appearance of the Cheney excerpts this week on CNN and elsewhere in the news media space has prompted a flurry of denials from various spokespersons."The book belongs in the fiction section of the bookstore," said Steve Cheung, spokesman for Trump. Until the events of late 2020 and early 2021, Cheney was the third ranking Republican in the House behind GOP Leader McCarthy and party whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana (who is now majority leader under Speaker Johnson).Cheney was at the time a strong prospect to be the first Republican woman elected speaker. That was surely an ambition with special meaning for her parents, who met as graduate students and had coauthored a book about speakers in history. Cheney's father, Richard, was himself a potential Speaker when he was a congressman from Wyoming and also the minority whip, the House GOP's second-ranking leader, in the late 1980s. Instead, he left Congress to be secretary of Defense under President George H.W. Bush and was elected vice president under President George W. Bush in 2000. His wife Lynne, Liz Cheney's mother, was director of the National Endowment for the Humanities under President Ronald Reagan.Although lifelong Republicans, both Cheney's parents have backed her resistance to Trump. That includes the year she spent as the high-profile vice chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol, a panel whose last act was to recommend that the DOJ bring criminal charges against Trump. While her performance in that role won her many new admirers, mostly outside the GOPCheney was urged by Democrats and "never Trumpers" in the GOP to run againstThere is no good time for a book as critical of one's own party as After two rounds of bruising battles over the speakership, the House majority has yet to pass most of its spending bills. Even a perennially popular piece of legislation such as the annual reauthorizing of the Department of Defense  stalled in Congress for the first time in six decades. Yet valuable floor time continues to be expended on relatively minor matters. And the media coverage continues to focus on such dysfunction as the ethics case against Republican freshman George Santos of New York. The House spent Friday morning on a motion to expel Santos, based on a thoroughly damning report from the Republican-run ethics committee.About half the chamber's Republicans voted against expulsion, some arguing it was bad precedent to expel members facing criminal charges before they had been tried and convicted. With Santos gone, the GOP majority is down to three seats to spare. So stay tuned. There can always be yet another surprise.

tile: In Gaza, renewed fighting dims hopes of a longer-term pause for humanitarian aid
topic type: Middle East crisis — explained
written by: By Becky Sullivan, Brian Mann
date: 12/02/2023
content: TEL AVIV, Israel — For seven days, the people of Gaza could stand in long lines waiting for water, cooking gas and bread, without fear of an incoming airstrike. Hospitals could treat the injured without worrying about new strikes sending additional patients their way. Aid groups delivered tens of thousands of tons of aid across the territory, including in Gaza's north, where fighting had been too intense to safely distribute it.  But on Friday, a week-long ceasefire — brokered to allow the exchange of Hamas-held hostages and Israeli-held Palestinian detainees — "This is a man-made catastrophe. It looks like an earthquake, a famine and a massive epidemic," said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, in an interview with NPR before the fighting resumed. "The only logical answer is a true ceasefire."The week-long pause in fighting had allowed the delivery of thousands of tons of food and water, nearly 150 tons of medical supplies and roughly 30,000 liters of fuel to shelters operated by the United Nations in the north of Gaza, the U.N. said. Ambulances ferried critically wounded patients to Egypt. The break in fighting also allowed several hospitals in northern Gaza to re-open for limited services. Officials in Gaza warned that the open hospitals would be unable to receive large numbers of wounded once fighting resumed. Nearly 20 other hospitals remained closed. Even in the south of Gaza, where some fuel and medical supplies have been more frequently delivered, medical facilities remained overwhelmed, hospital staff told NPR. "The condition at this hospital is so bad because we are loading everything on our shoulders," said Dr. Mohamed Yasouri, an emergency room physician at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. "We can save life or save organs if we have enough medical equipment," he added — but they don't. But the pause did little to improve access to water for northern Gaza. A lack of fuel and damage to infrastructure kept water production facilities shut, humanitarian groups reported, leaving small U.N.- or privately-operated wells as the primary sources of potable water in the north.And the supply of other critical goods — like cooking gas — remained limited. Before the pause, about 20 trucks of aid were being delivered into Gaza each day via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. But aid organizations, including the U.N., reported that no humanitarian aid had been allowed into the territory Friday. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian group, "This decision exacerbates the suffering of citizens and increases the challenges facing humanitarian and relief organizations in alleviating the hardships of citizens and displaced persons due to the ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip," the group said. In response, Israeli officials said that trucks would be allowed into Gaza. The White House was also optimistic that a flow of aid would begin again, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Friday, though "probably in terms of dozens of trucks, versus hundreds of trucks," he added. As many as 1.8 million Palestinians are thought to be internally displaced since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead, according to Israeli officials. In the weeks since the attack, the Israeli offensive in Gaza has resulted in at least 13,300 deaths, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and led aid groups to warn that overcrowding and deteriorating sanitary conditions are heightening the risk of infectious disease. More than a million people are registered with shelters run by UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees. The shelters are designed to accommodate 1,500 people each, but currently there are, on average, about 6,000 at each one, U.N. officials say. At one UNRWA school-turned-shelter, officials reported an outbreak of hepatitis A. "To give you an example, we're averaging 125 people using one toilet. So basic things like sanitation in these shelters is very difficult. People are jammed into very congested classrooms in the evenings," said Thomas White, the director of UNRWA in Gaza, This week, the World Health Organization warned that untreated disease could ultimately kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the territory's health infrastructure is not restored. Officials report tens of thousands of cases of respiratory infections, diarrhea and skin rash — and attributed the outbreaks to overcrowding, a lack of food, water, sanitation and basic hygiene and challenges with waste management.  "We need a ceasefire. A ceasefire that holds," WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus By sundown, hundreds of strikes hit targets across Gaza, including in the south, the Israeli military reported. The Gaza Ministry of Health said nearly 180 people were killed and nearly 600 others injured. Shaimaa Ahmed, 20, a computer engineering student sheltering in central Gaza, told NPR on Friday that the renewed fighting felt "suffocating." "We really thought we couldn't bear it anymore if this thing started again. We've already seen enough. We've already gone through enough," Ahmed said. "But apparently it wasn't enough for them."

content:Hamas has released over 100 of the more than 240 people it kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 as part of a hostage and prisoner exchange enabled by the weeklong cease-fire that ended on Friday. Those freed in Gaza were mostly women and children, including some foreign nationals.At the same time, hundreds of Arab residents of the West Bank who had been held in prisons by Israel In Israel, as the freed hostages return home, Israeli and U.S. media have been awash with photos and Most hostages have not spoken with the media directly, though Some families say their relatives lost weight and came home with head lice. One man said his aunt had to Family members of several hostages of all ages described them as For many, feelings of relief are mixed with those of guilt and exhaustion. And relatives and experts have voiced concern about the potential long-term effects of the ordeal on hostages, particularly young children. That's what the family of "I think that we will only learn as the days go on, and for a long time, what really effectively will be the results of having been a hostage and having been in her father's arms when he was murdered," Hirsh Naftali said. Experts told NPR that the road to recovery from such an experience can be long, but there are steps that caregivers, loved ones and professionals can take to help children who were held hostage navigate a path forward. In anticipation of the release of hostages, Israel's health ministry worked with child trauma specialists to come up with a handbook for Ayelet Noam-Rosenthal, a social worker at the Haruv Institute in Jerusalem and one of the authors of the guide, says it includes protocols for "everyone that will meet the child," from parents to pediatricians to teachers. "Here in Israel after the horrific events of Oct. 7, where children were kidnapped after witnessing massacre and severe violence, we actually understood that we have to focus also on the day after," she told NPR. "That means the day after they return, and address both their immediate and long-term needs." The It has instructions for the Israeli soldiers accompanying children on their way to the hospital, including how to introduce themselves and how to answer (or deflect) their questions, Hostages are to be brought to one of six Israeli hospitals, where they can reunite with family members and receive a suitcase with some of their clothing, medications and personal items. They also receive a thorough medical exam, which the The guide says those exams should check for evidence of rape or torture, and that if any is found, "appropriate professionals" should be consulted on whether it would be possible collect the evidence or interview the patient without re-traumatizing them. There is also guidance on proper nutrition and avoiding potentially-fatal refeeding syndrome, which can happen when food is reintroduced to a malnourished person.Liz Cathcart, the executive director of the nonprofit Hostage U.S. (which supports families of Americans taken hostage but cannot comment on which cases it is working on) says malnutrition is common among hostages. That could be due to a lack of nutritious food and food in general or the inability to keep food down because of stress. Other potential issues include vitamin deficiencies, diseases contracted in captivity and sleep disturbances, according to The physical health of the hostages is the immediate priority, "Without the physical health checks and making sure that your physical health is up to par, you're not able to then take the next steps to recovery and reintegration," she says. Noam-Rosenthal says parents and professionals should take every precaution to avoid re-traumatizing children who were held captive. "We must all work together to strengthen the child's resilience and work toward his or her adjustment to the new circumstances," she says. For instance, the Noam-Rosenthal says it's crucial to rebuild trust "because that's one of the things these children lost along the way."One of the first things her team tells family members is that they need to give children their autonomy back — for example, letting them set the pace for physical touch, even if the parents are desperate to hug them immediately. Longer-term, she says it's importantBuilding resilience and coping skills are key to helping former captives adjust to their new normal, Cathcart says. And it's not just the hostages themselves who need help. Families of hostages are coming off a "two-month marathon" of worrying about and fighting for their loved ones' release, Cathcart says. Before they can shift their focus to that person's recovery, she says, they need to take care of themselves too. "What I always encourage families to do when their loved one gets home is to focus on yourself, too, because it's so important that the families are mentally healthy, that they're fed, that they have energy," she adds. "Because if they don't, they're not going to be able to support their family member." "The use of simple words and short sentences is important," the ministry advises, according to CNN. "It is important to convey that we are open and able to hear and talk about difficult things." As part of the temporary truce, Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners, Prior to Oct. 7, some 500-700 Palestinian children were subjected to Israeli military detention every year, in some cases without charge, trial or due process guarantees, according to The organization welcomed the release of both Israeli and Palestinian children as part of the deal. But Jason Lee, Save the Children's country director in the Palestinian Territories, called it "just the first step needed" in addressing a decades-old crisis affecting children in the region. "A lasting ceasefire must be agreed immediately, all hostages in Gaza must be released, and the appalling emotional and physical abuse of Palestinian children in detention must end," he added. More than 13,300 Palestinians — roughly two-thirds of them women and minors — have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.  The United Nations has warned that Gaza is becoming a "graveyard for children," while the World Health Organization has raised alarms about the spread of infectious diseases in the territory. And researchers are worried about Studies conducted before the current conflict documented especially high rates of mental and behavioral health issues among Gaza's youth, who make up

tile: Why solar-powered canoes could be good for the future of the rainforest
topic type: Goats and Soda
written by: By Peter Yeung
date: 12/02/2023
content:Shortly after sunrise, the students of Barrio San Luis begin their school run. Around a dozen girls and boys, wearing backpacks and carrying notepads in hand, hop down the muddy river bank and into the boat that provides their daily transport.Their highway is the Rio Wichimi, a chocolatey brown river lined with towering, parrot-filled trees. It winds through pristine jungle deep into the Ecuadorian Amazon. And the fuel that powers their vessel – a large canoe with a roof of glossy black panels – is the fierce tropical sun."We don't have roads here," says Nela Atamait, a teacher accompanying the kids on their way downstream to a high school in the village of Wichimi. "So we travel by river, like our ancestors did. It's more natural and it doesn't destroy our forest."Since 2016, the Indigenous Achuar people have navigated a fleet of solar-powered boats along the Amazonian waters of eastern Ecuador, enabling them to sell wares at markets, carry out administrative tasks in cities, monitor for illegal loggers, ferry around wildlife-spotting tourists and study at school.The project, set up by the Ecuadorian nonprofit Since the turn of the century, Ecuador has lost about 2.3 million acres of tree cover, which is about 5% of its previous total and larger in size than Yellowstone National Park, according to "Mining, logging and extraction of natural resources like oil require the building of roads, which cause pollution, deforestation and brings outsiders that can dilute local cultures," says Sofía Jarrín Hidalgo, Ecuador adviser for the non-profit In an effort to minimize that destruction, Kara Solar is investing in what it describes as the "ancestral highways" of the rainforest: rivers. By pairing nature's pre-built infrastructure with solar energy, it believes the livelihoods of communities across the Amazon can be greatly improved with minimal environmental impact. River travel across the region, usually via gasoline-powered canoes known locally as "peque-peques," can be expensive because fuel must be flown in by plane – increasing the cost of gasoline to as much as five times more than in the capital Quito. Hence, the allure of harnessing the limitless rays of the Amazonian sun.To date, Kara Solar has built six electric boats – serving nine communities and hundreds of passengers along 60 miles of routes in Ecuador. Four solar centers charge the boats – supplementing the onboard solar panels – and also provide power for lighting and internet in Indigenous villages."The technology has been important, it is helping us to have autonomy," says Nuntu Canelos, an Achuar who leads Kara Solar's operations on the ground. The boats, inspired by traditional Indigenous designs, vary in size and can carry up to 20 passengers. With electric motors and roofs covered in solar panels, they can travel at 10 to 12 miles an hour for up to 60 miles. Each cost between $25,000 and $40,000, most of which was provided by U.S.-based foundations such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Kara Solar says that with technological advances, prices are coming down."We want to show that another way is possible," says founder Oliver Utne. He arrived in Ecuador from the United States in 2007 and came up with the idea for solar-powered boats after witnessing the deforestation caused by road construction in the Achuar's territory.The Achuar have inhabited Ecuador's rainforest for many generations in careful balance with its ecosystems. Now they find themselves pulled in two directions: toward both conservation and development. On the one hand, they are keenly aware of the deforestation, pollution and loss of biodiversity caused by building roads on their "It's vital we improve infrastructure and provide alternative incomes for Indigenous people in ways that don't rely on depleting natural resources," says Hidalgo.The tension of development versus conservation is playing out across the Amazon and other tropical rainforests globally. But Utne believes if Indigenous communities are supported with "clean transport networks and technological independence" then they will be better equipped to resist pressures to degrade their ancestral lands.There are signs that this alternative vision could be working. Kara Solar estimates that the fleet of solar boats has completed more than 2,000 journeys, racking up tens of thousands of miles of solar-powered river travel across the region.In Sharamentsa, one of the main ports along the Rio Pastaza, the solar boat has proven particularly useful. Achuar have used it to transport tourists drawn to the rich biodiversity, which includes jaguars, toucans and endemic butterflies. They also relied on the solar boats during the pandemic, when a months-long halt on flights meant that gasoline could no longer be flown in."Every single day I was driving the boat, everyone was asking me for help," says Luciano Peas, a 27-year-old Achuar skipper who was trained by Kara Solar. "They said: 'I need to go to my farm. I need to visit my parents. I need to go for medical treatment.' "The Achuar also say they used the solar-powered boats to monitor and guard their forest during the pandemic, which saw an influx of loggers working for Chinese companies in search of balsa trees and their valuable, lightweight timber."Some communities let the loggers take wood because it was a tough time and they needed money," says Peas. But Sharamentsa's greater autonomy, in part thanks to their solar boats, enabled them to push back against the loggers. "We didn't sell our trees. We work for ourselves and we must defend our territory."Even some residents without direct access to a river say they are seeing the benefits of solar transport. In the community of Karakam, a hike through the jungle from Wichimi, people say they believe sustainable transportation will help them preserve their traditions and culture."We are defenders of the Amazon," says Vincente Mukuchan, a 42-year-old wearing a toucan-feather headdress. "If we can have a good quality of life without gasoline, we are ready and open to embrace it. We want our sons to continue our ways of life."As a result, the solar boats have won growing support. "I don't want highways [because] trees will have to be cut down," says Esperanza Sharimit, a 63-year-old resident living in a traditional thatched hut in Wichimi. "Now the air is pure here. We don't have pollution. There's no noise from cars. It's beautiful."Getting residents' buy-in has been a fundamental goal for Kara Solar. The project began with a decade of discussions with Achuar communities before the first solar boat set sail, and is still led and inspired by the Indigenous groups.Kara Solar's project is reminiscent of a tale from Achuar mythology about a "fire canoe" resembling an electric eel that carries the forest animals on its back along the river – heralding an age of health and prosperity. The nonprofit itself takes its name from the Achuar language: Kara means "a vision that becomes real.""Our ancestors have always lived in the rainforest and we must take care of it," says Wakiach Kuja, president of Not all Achuar, however, have been won over by the idea of a solar-powered future. Tiyua Uyunkar, former president of NAE and current prefect of the province of Morona Santiago, flew to China in September for Tiyua Uyunkar did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.Kara Solar is also working against the currents of convenience. The solar boats are considerably slower than gasoline-powered boats, meaning that many still prefer the latter for important or urgent matters. And given the new technology, breakdowns and technological hiccups are still an issue.But with time, Kara Solar says reliability will improve. And it has created a roving team of eight Indigenous technicians to address any mechanical issues; they travel to communities to carry out repairs. Eventually, they will assemble boats. "We like to produce things ourselves, without relying on others," says Walter Washikiat, the lead technician.Further advances are in the works, too. Washikiat says new boats will no longer have panels on their roofs but instead will be run by changeable batteries that can be charged separately, reducing turnaround times. A smaller, more maneuverable motor is also being developed, which would allow boats to more easily navigate the obstacle-strewn rivers.Washikiat's goal is to have a solar boat and charging center in every riverside Achuar community. He has already helped deploy solar vessels in other countries, including Peru, Brazil, Suriname and the Solomon Islands."We can keep on multiplying," he says.But for now, the Achuars' experience provides a glimpse of a solar-powered future in the Amazon rainforest.Along the Rio Wichimi, a solar boat carrying a handful of passengers weaves through the steamy dense rainforest filled with squawking parrots and howling monkeys on its weekly trip to Puerto Nunkui, the nearest marketplace and transport hub.Wilfrido Kawarim, an Achuar and a government official, is using the solar boat for the first time after visiting a remote community in the rainforest for outreach work. "It creates less pollution and it's less noisy," he says. "It is a beautiful idea."

tile: Bringing up a baby can be a tough and lonely job. Here's a solution: alloparents
topic type: Goats and Soda
written by: By Michaeleen Doucleff
date: 12/01/2023
content:A squishy, slippery blob that cries often. Sometimes very often. That's how you – and everyone of us – began our lives. "Even the most adorable, sweet, easy babies are a ton of work," says psychologist In Western societies, much of the responsibility often falls to one person. In many instances, that's the mother, who must muster the patience and sensitivity to care for an infant. And a lot of time she's working in isolation, says evolutionary anthropologist "There are these narratives [in Western society], that mothers should just know how to look after children and be able to do it [alone]," says Chaudhary, who's at Cambridge University.But human parents probably aren't psychologically adapted for this isolation, a new study with a group of hunter-gatherers in the Congo suggests. A "mismatch" likely exists between the conditions in which humans evolved to care for babies and the situation many parents find themselves in today, says Salali, who contributed to the study.Together with a handful of previous studies, this new one suggests that for the vast majority of human history, mothers had a huge amount of help caring for infants – and even a lot of support with toddlers as well. We're not talking about just an extra hand on the weekends. We're talking about more than a dozen people for daily help with all sorts of tasks – cleaning a child, holding them, keeping an eye on them and soothing them when they cry. Scientists call these helpers "alloparents." The prefix "allo" derives from the Greek word for "other." So these helpers are literally "other parents."The study, In the study, evolutionary anthropologist "So you're just writing down all that information constantly," he says. Chaudhary and Salali analyzed all the data and found striking patterns. "The numbers were really quite amazing," Chaudhary says. "Each child had about 15 to 20 caregivers, but in terms of people providing hands-on care, the number was lower."On average, the children had eight people, other than their mothers, giving regular hands-on care, such as bathing, feeding and loving them with kisses, hugs and stroking. The youngsters had two to three other people responding to their crying. And these alloparents responded quickly. Chaudhary documented a total of about 220 bouts of crying that didn't resolve quickly. Half the time, these caregivers responded within 10 seconds. And for 90% of the crying bouts help arrived within 25 seconds. Altogether, the alloparents provided about 36% of the close care for babies.  Fathers provided another 6% and mothers provided the rest — about 60%. "The moms just have so much support," says UCL's Gul Deniz Salali. "When I became a mom, I had to pay somebody to teach me how to breastfeed. It was so difficult at the beginning, and I was on the verge of depression, really. So I do think that this allocare is really helpful."The study was quite small, with only 18 children, Kathryn Humphreys at Vanderbilt notes. So it's hard to draw generalizations for the full community in Congo."However, they studied the children in a way that allowed them to really understand what the children's day-to-day life is like, which is important," she adds. "That's also quite different from most research on early caregiving relationships, in which researchers usually study a child with one caregiver – typically mom – in the lab for ten minutes of free play time."The findings also support a handful of similar studies with hunter-gatherer communities, looking at how much support new moms receive from members of the community. For example, one study, Hunter-gatherer communities are not the only ones to rely on – and value – alloparents. Studies on a variety of cultures worldwide show that new mothers almost always have a system of care around them, says Altogether the research across cultures suggests that human parents are psychologically adapted to raise children cooperatively, not in isolation. Yet in Western culture, many times the mother alone is expected – or even required – to provide this incredibly intensive parenting, Emmott says. "There's this idea that mothering is so important. And there's lots and lots of research on sensitive parenting by the mother."So, as the paper puts it, there's a "mismatch" between how parents are primed evolutionarily to take care of babies and how they're expected to do it, or even how they end up doing a portion of it. This mismatch and isolation may be a key reason for high rates of postpartum depression in the U.S. and Europe, several of the researchers point out."It's almost certainly true that we weren't really adapted to raise children as a single parent or just as two-parent families," says developmental psychologist And thus, the research points to a clear way of reducing postpartum depression, Fearon says: "Let's try to build a society and enact policies that provide parents with more social support," he says. "It's sort of obvious, but it's not so easy to do."So we end up with a second mismatch, beyond the evolutionary one, says UCL's Emily Emmott. "There's a kind of societal mismatch," she says, between how our society is set up to raise young children and what caretakers actually need to do.""You need a lot of support when you have a baby, but the laws don't reflect that, and the child-care system available doesn't reflect that," Emmott says.So many primary caregivers end up relying largely on one other person: their partner. "Some women don't have a partner," she adds. "And what do you do when your partner needs to go to work? What are you supposed to do?  So I think many women are put in this impossible situation. They're set up to fail."And so, she says, it's not surprising that many new parents feel depressed.  "Because, a lot of the time, you are in a quite depressing situation." There's no shame in getting help with a baby, the researchers interviewed for this article point out. "Readers who are parents: Can you recall a time when you faced a tough time in child rearing — and had a perhaps unexpected and definitely welcome moment when an "alloparent" — a caregiver from your family or community — came to the rescue?

tile: Federal judge rejects Trump's immunity claims in 2020 election interference case
topic type: Elections

content:WASHINGTON — Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution in his election interference case in Washington, a federal judge ruled Friday, knocking down the Republican's bid to derail the case charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election.U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's decision amounts to a sharp rejection to challenges the Trump defense team had raised to the four-count indictment in advance of a trial expected to center on the Republican's multi-pronged efforts to undo the election won by Democrat Joe Biden.Though the judge turned aside Trump's expansive view of presidential power, the order might not be the final say in the legal fight. Lawyers for Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, are expected to quickly appeal to fight what they say an unsettled legal question.In her ruling, Chutkan said the office of the president "does not confer a lifelong 'get-out-of-jail-free' pass.""Former Presidents enjoy no special conditions on their federal criminal liability," Chutkan wrote. "Defendant may be subject to federal investigation, indictment, prosecution, conviction, and punishment for any criminal acts undertaken while in office."Chutkan also rejected Trump's claims that the indictment violates the former president's free speech rights. Lawyers for Trump had argued that he was within his First Amendment rights to challenge the outcome of the election and to allege that it had been tainted by fraud, and they accused prosecutors of attempting to criminalize political speech and political advocacy.But Chutkan said "it is well established that the First Amendment does not protect speech that is used as an instrument of a crime.""Defendant is not being prosecuted simply for making false statements ... but rather for knowingly making false statements in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy and obstructing the electoral process," she wrote.An attorney for Trump declined to comment Friday evening.Her ruling comes the same day the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and police officers who have accused Trump of inciting the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, can move forward.The appeals court in that case rejected Trump's sweeping claims that presidential immunity shields him from liability, but left the door open for him to continue to fight, as the cases proceed, to try to prove that his actions were taken his official capacity as president.Trump's legal team had argued the criminal case, which is scheduled to go to trial in March, should be dismissed because the 2024 Republican presidential primary front-runner is shielded from prosecution for actions he took while fulfilling his duties as president. They assert that the actions detailed in the indictment — including pressing state officials on the administration of elections — cut to the core of Trump's responsibilities as commander in chief.The Supreme Court has held that presidents are immune from civil liability for actions related to their official duties, but the justices have never grappled with the question of whether that immunity extends to criminal prosecution.The Justice Department has also held that sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. Trump's lawyers are trying to ensure that same protection to a former president for actions taken while in office, asserting that no prosecutor since the beginning of American democracy has had the authority to bring such charges."Against the weight of that history, Defendant argues in essence that because no other former Presidents have been criminally prosecuted, it would be unconstitutional to start now," Chutkan wrote. "But while a former President's prosecution is unprecedented, so too are the allegations that a President committed the crimes with which Defendant is charged."Special counsel Jack Smith's team has said there is nothing in the Constitution, or in court precedent, to support the idea that a former president cannot be prosecuted for criminal conduct committed while in the White House."The defendant is not above the law. He is subject to the federal criminal laws like more than 330 million other Americans, including Members of Congress, federal judges, and everyday citizens," prosecutors wrote in court papers.It's one of four criminal cases Trump is facing while he seeks to reclaim the White House in 2024.Smith has separately charged Trump in Florida with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House. Trump is also charged in Georgia with conspiring to overturn his election loss to Biden. And he faces charges in New York related to hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign.

content:About five years ago, Sarah Barak badly tore a ligament in her thumb and needed surgery to get it reattached. But when she went in for the operation, she got some unsolicited advice: The surgeon said she should lose weight, suggesting that her size and her injured thumb were connected."He was making the argument that my posture was affecting my arm pain and that my posture was made worse by my size, all of which could be true," Barak says. "But I still had a disconnected thumb, and even if I lost 100 pounds, the thumb would not have been reattached on its own."Barak says she's assertive about advocating for the care she needs — but it's draining."It's freaking exhausting," she says. "And frankly, not everyone can do it."For years, weight has been used as a measure of health in doctors' offices. Having a higher body mass index is But in recent years, research has Providers "There's so many horrible stories ... of diagnoses that were missed because the focus was on weight," Erlanger says. The evidence that focusing solely on weight can harm patients has led some in health care to examine their approach.In June, the American Medical Association started But a "In most cases, the care that you're providing should be the same no matter what the number on the scale is," says Moore started by trying to make her clinic feel comfortable for patients of all sizes. Every exam room has an array of blood pressure cuffs for different-size arms, as well as gowns and speculums of various sizes. The chairs and exam tables fit all patients.But it's Moore's approach to talking about weight that's most different from a more traditional practice."We don't recommend weight loss as a way of treating medical conditions," Moore says. Instead, she tells her patients that exercise and nutritious food are good for them "We recommend moving your body in a way that's sustainable, which hopefully is joyful," she says, and "eating food in a way that nourishes."Moore says that emphasizing the inherent benefits of exercise can help people start, as well as stick with, a "If after that discussion, a patient still is fairly certain that they want to focus on weight loss," Moore says, "I do tell them that it is likely to fail in the long term."For example, a "When someone loses weight, it kicks in a series of hormonal changes that tend to increase appetite and slow metabolism," says Moore says ultimately her goal is to focus on a patient's long-term health and make "recommendations that are much more likely to be sustainable.""By making the decision not to recommend weight loss, it opens a door rather than closes a door," she says. Schur and others who specialize in obesity medicine say they recognize the need for a new approach when talking to patients about their weight, but they say it's still possible to encourage weight loss when appropriate."For some folks who have a condition like diabetes, weight loss in combination with some lifestyle changes could be an option that they would choose," says Schur.She agrees with weight-neutral providers like Moore that encouraging patients to exercise and eat nutritious food has obvious benefits. Still, for some patients, weight loss can have additional benefits, she says.For example, studies have And Schur says that when weight loss might help, doctors should say that.While there's a long history of weight bias in American society, including in health care, Schur says it's possible to have conversations about weight loss that are sensitive and respectful."When a physician is approaching it in a nonjudgmental manner and not assuming that a person hasn't made changes, it can be discussed as a treatment option in a way that's supportive," she says.Schur says that increasingly, weight loss drugs like Wegovy are her primary tool for managing patients' weight."To be totally honest, what we've been asking them to do, you know, with just lifestyle alone has been unrealistic," she says.Critics of the newest weight loss drugs point to their limitations: They're And weight-neutral providers say that even in a world with these new drugs, people with larger bodies still need to feel heard and respected in the doctor's office and have their primary health concerns addressed.

tile: With ChatGPT turning 1, Americans wonder whether AI is coming for their jobs
topic type: Business

date: 12/01/2023
content:Baltimore illustrator John de Campos was irate when he discovered that some of his original work had been used to train an artificial intelligence chatbot — without his permission. "It's so gross," he says. In just the past year, AI-powered programs like Midjourney and DALL-E have made it possible for anyone to create highly sophisticated images with just a few clicks of the keyboard.For de Campos, that's an outrage. "The fact that human expression and art is now at risk and on the chopping block is super duper scary to me," he says.At the same time, de Campos, who aspires to make a living as a board game designer, has found ChatGPT to be a very effective helper when it comes to marketing his games on social media."I'll say, these are the qualities of the game that we're selling. Take all of this information, melt it down into 15 words or less. Give me five different versions written to sell this product on Instagram," he says.De Campos acknowledges the hypocrisy that this presents and says he's trying to decide whether he should divorce himself from using any AI tool."I feel so strongly about the art side and not so much about the text side, but I'm kind of figuring it out," he says.A year after the launch of ChatGPT, people in all kinds of occupations are figuring out where to draw the line with AI. Attitudes toward the new technology vary widely, with little consensus over which tasks can and should be handed over to bots.In Michigan, Ethan Kissel has been turning to AI for help with his job producing television commercials for local businesses. "It's really good for spitballing ideas," he says.In the past, Kissel would spend an hour or more writing a 15- or 30-second script, with the hardest part being the tagline — the last, most memorable sentence. He discovered ChatGPT can deliver dozens of taglines in just a matter of seconds."Most of them are probably trash," he says. "But you take a bit from one and a couple words from another and fashion them all together, and suddenly you have something that you actually kind of like."Kissel can easily can envision a future in which copywriters become dispensable, along with voice actors who do narration. His company already uses an AI tool to fix mispronunciations if they're short on time.For now, though, Kissel is less worried about his own job. In addition to writing scripts, he also shoots and edits video and meets with clients. Being a jack-of-all-trades, he says, offers some protection."I don't think it's as scary of a problem for 'the right now.' But it is one that we need to discuss and plan for," he says.Across professions, there are hints of what the future holds. Newspapers have used AI to write recaps of high school sports matches. Video game companies are using AI to create new characters. Software developers are using AI to write code. Karin Kimbrough, chief economist for LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, doesn't see AI coming for everyone's jobs right away. But she says AI will undoubtedly change how most people spend time on the job."You might spend less time on routine tasks," she says. "You might spend more time on things... that are really using your human-powered skills, your skills of empathy and ethical judgment, your skills of managing and leading people."Ultimately, Kimbrough says, the hope is that AI will make people more efficient and productive.But there are lots of pitfalls to avoid along the way. The internet is filled with stories of AI chatbots confidently delivering complete fabrications. A New York lawyer was sanctioned this year after being caught citing bogus cases in a lawsuit against an airline. In court, he admitted he had used ChatGPT for legal research and hadn't bothered to double check the bot's work.Such cases make it easy to see how irresponsible use of AI could end up harming people and society.Jeffrey Garcia, a program manager for a tech company, has taken it upon himself to figure out what AI is good at and what it's not, partly for fun but also to stay on top of developments that could shape his future employment. His experimentation over the past year has given him a glimpse into the technology's shortfalls and potential.As a child, Garcia was always frustrated with his inability to replicate on paper beautiful images conjured up in his mind."I have a deep love for art," he says. "But I suck at it."This past spring, he wondered, could he open an Etsy store with a few products created with Midjourney? His first undertaking: a vintage-style poster of a favorite bird, the Baltimore oriole.The program delivered a fairly sophisticated image of an oriole in front of a Baltimore skyline, but there were a few problems. Garcia's wife, a biologist, found extra toes on the bird's feet. The skyline did include a few recognizable landmarks but wouldn't hold up for anyone who knows the city.Garcia didn't go on to sell any of his posters but concluded it would be fairly easy to commoditize such a product, especially given the rapid advancements AI image-generating tools have made. This fall, he tried using the newly-released DALL-E 3 to create the same poster and got a much-improved image, though still not free of anatomical errors."It's getting better, but still not good enough to pass the snuff of someone who knows what's going on," he says.Experiments like this have informed how Garcia uses AI for work. He thinks of ChatGPT as a naïve assistant who can fairly effectively write first drafts, but whose work must be verified and edited.And there are still some parts of his job that he's not ready to relinquish. Correspondence is one of them."I don't feel comfortable handing off this thing that I view as essential and deeply human to an automated system," he says.

topic type: Asia

content:VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE, Calif. — South Korea launched its first military spy satellite into space Friday, a little over a week after North Korea claimed to put its own spy satellite into orbit for the first time as tensions rise between the rivals.Launched from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base using SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, it was the first of five spy satellites South Korea plans to send into space by 2025 under a contract with SpaceX. The event had been scheduled for earlier in the week but was pushed back because of weather conditions.South Korea had no military reconnaissance satellites of its own in space and has partially resorted to the United States' spy satellites to monitor moves by North Korea.South Korea's Defense Ministry described the launch as successful, saying the satellite had a communication with an overseas ground station.A ministry statement said the launch allowed the South Korean military to acquire an independent space-based surveillance system. It said the satellite would also help bolster the military's preemptive missile strike capability, a key part of its so-called three-axis system that includes missile defense and massive retaliatory capabilities.After two launch failures earlier this year, North Korea said it successfully placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit last week. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn't yet released any of those satellite photos.U.S. and South Korean officials confirmed the North Korean satellite entered orbit, but many outside experts question whether it can send militarily useful high-resolution imagery.The North Korean satellite launch sparked immediate, strong condemnations from the U.S., South Korea and others. Multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions ban any satellite launches by North Korea, viewing them as covers for testing its long-range missile technology.North Korea responded angrily, saying it has sovereign rights to launch spy satellites to cope with what it calls increasing U.S. hostilities. It said it would also launch additional ones.On Saturday, North Korea's Defense Ministry threatened to take unspecified steps to eliminate or undermine the capabilities of U.S. spy satellites in protest of what it called the "rubbish" comments by an unspecified U.S. Space Command official that hinted at an attack on the North Korean satellite. The North Korean ministry said it would consider such an action a declaration of war.The North's statement followed remarks by Sheryll Klinkel, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Space Forces that were carried in Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government-funded news service, earlier in the week.Asked whether the United States has the ability to block the operation of North Korea's spy satellite, the RFA report quoted Klinkel as saying that "Joint Force space operations could deny an adversary's space and counterspace capabilities and services using a variety of reversible and irreversible means, reducing the effectiveness and lethality of adversary forces across all domains."North Korea's satellite launch has inflamed animosities between the two Koreas, with the rivals taking steps to breach a previous military agreement meant to ease front-line military tensions.Spy satellites are among the high-tech weapons systems that Kim Jong Un has publicly vowed to introduce. Since 2022, North Korea has conducted about 100 ballistic missile tests — part of efforts to modernize its arsenal of weapons targeting South Korea and the United States. South Korea and the United States have expanded their military exercises.South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers last week that Russia's technological assistance likely enabled North Korea to place its spy satellite into orbit. South Korea, the U.S. and Japan have accused North Korea of seeking high-tech Russian technologies needed to enhance its military programs in return for supplying conventional arms to support Russia's war in Ukraine. Both Russia and North Korea have denied the allegation.

topic type: Politics
written by: By Eric McDaniel
date: 12/01/2023
content:Members of the House of Representatives voted 311-114 Friday morning to expel New York Republican George Santos from Congress. Santos is the sixth House member ever to be expelled from Congress.Santos is accused by prosecutors of a number of financial misdeeds, including reimbursing himself for loans to his congressional campaign that he appears to have never actually made — in essence, stealing money from campaign donors.Almost all Democrats and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos, who will now be replaced in a special election.The date for that vote has not yet been set.Santos represented a district that President Biden won by 10 percentage points, and the decision to expel him shrinks Republicans' already razor-thin majority in the House.Santos left the Capitol building quickly after the vote, making few remarks to reporters.At a news conference the day before, Santos said that Congress was taking the job of the American people, who he says should have been allowed to decide his fate at the ballot box. He also suggested that this would not be the last time folks heard from him."I'm 35," Santos said. "This doesn't mean it is goodbye forever."The freshman lawmaker was mired in controversy since before he was sworn in to Congress.Among other lies, the 35-year-old Santos falsely claimed that he had been a volleyball star at Baruch College, that he had worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and that he was Jewish — stories he later amended or recanted in a "I'm embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my résumé," Santos told the Then, in May, Santos was indicted on 13 criminal charges including wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making materially false statements to the House of Representatives.In October, prosecutors added an additional 10 charges in a superseding indictment, following a plea deal by a former campaign finance official affiliated with Santos' campaign.Led by Republican Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, lawmakers on the House Ethics Committee put together a report that corroborated many of the allegations contained in the indictments.After the report was released, just before the Thanksgiving holiday, Guest put forward the resolution to expel Santos from the House of Representatives.It is rare.Three men were expelled for supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War.More recently, Democrats Michael Myers and James Traficant were expelled after being convicted of bribery — in 1980 and 2002, respectively.Before the vote, Santos said he would wear the distinction "as a badge of honor."The House Republican leadership had announced that it would not try to marshal its members to vote for or against Santos' expulsion.The morning of the vote, though, the Republican leadership announced that it would be voting against the measure. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., a constitutional lawyer, said he was concerned about the precedent of expelling a member who had not yet been convicted of a crime.Just before the vote was about to begin, Rep. Max Miller of Ohio, one of Santos' Republican colleagues, sent an email to the full Republican conference, writing that he and his mother were victims of credit card fraud tied to Santos' campaign and that he would be voting to remove Santos."Neither my Mother nor I approved these charges or were aware of them," Miller wrote in the email obtained by NPR. "We have spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees in the resulting follow up."Ultimately, the pressure was enough to reach the two-thirds support necessary to remove Santos from office.

Her single, "drivers license," became a gargantuan hit, anointing her with the sort of teenage stardom more common in the early aughts. The album that followed, This year, Rodrigo caught a second bolt of lightning in her proverbial bottle with In this session, she talks about writing "I think I just had to learn how to A) Just try to write music that I wanted to hear. That was, like, my primary goal in the studio. I don't care about beating anything that came before. I don't care about how it does on the charts or if the radio stations like it. Whatever. I just wanted to make something that I would love. And B) I think I really had to learn how to have discipline in the craft of songwriting. I just had to show up every day and write something, even if I didn't particularly feel like it. I think it really sharpened my skills as a songwriter having to do that ..."I'm a big believer in quantity. I'm a big quantity-based songwriter. I just write so many bad songs, and I think that's how you get to the good ones. I think just, like, showing the creative gods that you're there, showing up, ready to do the work, goes a long way. It's half the battle."But there were certain days where I was in the studio where I would just kind of be petrified with fear and hearing all these voices in my head and feeling all this pressure, that sometimes I kind of felt like I couldn't really write or be as creative as I wanted to. That's definitely a hurdle that I had to overcome while making this album.""I was reading "One of the kids was talking about his mom, who he ran away from, and he said that she was an 'all-American bitch.' I thought that that was such an interesting title, and so I wrote it down. Yeah, I love this song so much. It's kind of a satire about what I feel like the perfect, all-American woman should be and all these confines that girls and women are placed into in our society. I really love it. It's really fun, and I'm very excited to play it on tour too. I think it's going to be a rager.""I love acting. I've been acting since I was so young — I started "I was so nervous.

You know, I can write the songs I want to write and make the music videos I want to make. I know that's a luxury that not everyone is afforded in this industry, especially young girls. I'm very lucky in that sense."I've always just been really inspired by female singer-songwriters. I remember discovering "People like "I've been thinking about it a lot.

content:The legendary – and controversial — soprano "I take very seriously the responsibility to Maria's life and legacy," the actress said recently in a statement about That film, in production now, is just one of the myriad ways Callas still looms large 47 years after her death. Her albums are routinely reissued, and this fall Why does Callas endure? Is it her melodramatic rags-to-riches story? Her doomed love life? Her sudden and early death? The best place to start looking for an answer is the voice — a voice adored by some, hated by others. "It is a matter of loving my kind of voice or not," Callas said in an interview that aired on WQXR in the 1970s. "Some people say I have a beautiful voice and some people say I have not. It's a matter of opinion." Few opera fans, even today, are without convictions when it comes to the Callas voice and what she did with it."She was and is, in my opinion, the queen of opera," declares soprano Angel Blue, who currently sings many of Callas' most famous roles. "I would describe Maria Callas' voice as every emotion at once. I listen to her and I feel joy, I feel pain, at the same time."Even Callas' most ardent fans would admit that her voice was not perfect, or perhaps not always beautiful in a traditional way. Lyndsy Spence, author of the biography Callas is in her own category, according to author and Metropolitan Opera producer William Berger. "To me, it was about the way she inhabited characters with her voice. And by characters, I don't just mean characters in a synopsis. I mean archetypes." Berger says she not only found intellectual and vocal heft in the roles she sang, but etched her portrayals in stone, locating the essence of a character that others only reached for. That rigor, he adds, could be disturbing: "It's so scary, in a way, when we hear her sing "When I listen to Maria Callas, I can hear her life story," Blue explains. "Listening to her sing 'Born to immigrant Greek parents who squabbled and separated, Callas moved to Athens from New York in 1937 with her domineering mother and sister, both of whom she fought with bitterly. She threw herself into opera, singing her first lead role at age 15. In 1947, in Italy, her international career took flight, and theEven with all the success, Callas was conflicted. She would have given it all up just to find true love, settle down and raise a family. Instead, she became something closer to a figure of Greek tragedy — an artist who rose from poverty, sacrificed everything for her art and died, brokenhearted, at 53.Spence says Callas channeled all of her pain and suffering in her music, and occasionally her joy. "I think of her [1964] recording of But Berger warns against falling into a kind of schadenfreude trap. "I am uncomfortable with people almost enjoying the tragedy and not going to the courageous next step of the transcendence of that which she was putting out there. The idea of pigeonholing that great artist as a victim negates the artist who has shown you how to do something better with it."Throughout her life, Callas the ferocious artist existed in perpetual conflict with Maria the vulnerable woman. That was a contradiction Spence couldn't resist exploring. "Her story, in my opinion, has been hijacked by people who don't know very much about Maria the woman," Spence says. "And I really wanted to get to the bottom of who Maria the person was."The Maria whom Spence found was someone, beyond the tabloid stories and high-fashion lifestyle, not so different from us. She loved watching Westerns on television, playing with her dog and collecting recipes. "I felt that in the end," Spence says, "this is just an ordinary woman with an extraordinary talent. She was the greatest for a reason and she put the work in. It wasn't just luck. It wasn't a publicity machine. She deserves all of the accolades that we're giving her, even today." Despite the accolades, suffering was a real part of Callas' story. She faced a disastrous love life with a gold-digging older husband and later an abusive lover in Onassis, pushy impresarios, a few overdoses from sleeping pills and a voice that began to show signs of wear uncommonly early. The last of those was irresistible fodder for the Callas detractors, who speculated that her new, slimmed-down figure in the early 1950s had led to vocal problems. And yet, some of her most vivid recordings were made in 1964, near the end of her career, including a complete From hunger during the war years in Greece to being bullied by the men in her life, Callas persisted to become In the end, true love may have eluded Callas. But her art, William Berger says, endures forever. "I don't see how Maria Callas can ever be forgotten. The name has become part of the communal unconscious."

One of the top agenda items was Taiwan, a democratically elected island that China claims as its own. Xi called the island of 24 million people the most important, most sensitive issue driving U.S.-China tensions. Well, the person who handles U.S. policy on Taiwan on a daily basis is Sandra Oudkirk. Our correspondent Emily Feng met her in Taipei.EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Sandra Oudkirk directs the American Institute in Taiwan - or AIT - in practice, the U.S.'s embassy here in all but name.SANDRA OUDKIRK: We are not an embassy. We do not travel with diplomatic passports.FENG: That's because the U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as an independent country. It's one of the many diplomatic workarounds Oudkirk deals with daily - managing the U.S. policy on Taiwan and on China, just next door. And it's precisely because of this delicate balance that she applauds the dialogue between the U.S. and China at the APEC summit.OUDKIRK: Communication reduces miscalculations, and so I think that's important not just for Taiwan, but for the whole region and really for the whole world.FENG: But Oudkirk is firm in what the U.S. is committed to in helping Taiwan defend itself and will not budge on. After Xi met with Biden, China's foreign ministry asked the U.S. to stop selling arms to Taiwan and to support Beijing in peacefully taking control of the island - something the U.S. says Taiwan should decide for itself.OUDKIRK: Part of that approach to Taiwan is the agreement that the United States will sell defensive weapons to Taiwan sort of linked to the level of threat that Taiwan faces. So that's a commitment that the United States has made that isn't going to change.FENG: In fact, the Biden administration is looking to give more military help to Taiwan as part of a proposed military assistance bill in Congress in an effort to deter a potential invasion from China.OUDKIRK: Effective deterrence is a situation where the adversary looks at their target every day, every year, every three years, and says it's not worth it.FENG: Despite months of open speculation from both U.S. and Taiwan officials, there's been a recent shift in tone, and both now say a Chinese invasion is not likely to happen anytime soon.OUDKIRK: There's an important distinction between making plans and training troops and actually getting ready to do something. And the United States is confident that there is no imminent threat of invasion for Taiwan.FENG: Oudkirk, however, is concerned about narratives being planted on Taiwan social media platforms through doctored images and false claims in the run-up to a Taiwanese January election. It's not clear whether a state actor such as China is behind these narratives, but claims like this one - that the U.S. is deliberately weakening Taiwan's semiconductor companies - have been proliferating.OUDKIRK: The way to push back against disinformation and sort of deliberate information manipulation is to talk and to engage and to be approachable and also to work on things like media literacy.FENG: But these narratives seem to be taking a toll on Taiwanese confidence in the U.S. A November poll by the prominent research institution Academia Sinica in Taipei found only a third of Taiwanese citizens believe the U.S. to be a stable partner - down 11% from just two years ago. All this is happening as Taiwan enters its last full month of campaigning before its presidential election in January- one that will influence Taiwan's policy with China and with the U.S.Emily Feng, NPR News, Taipei, Taiwan.

Article 19
tile: The personal Sandra Day O'Connor: A backstage force and front stage star
topic type: Law
written by: By Nina Totenberg
date: 12/01/2023
content:For those too young to remember,  Sandra Day O'Connor was so admired on the public stage that there were even suggestions she run for president. She had no interest in that, but her vote and her approach to judging dominated the U.S Supreme Court for a quarter of a century, until her retirement.Whether the subject was affirmative action, states' rights, campaign finance, national security or abortion, hers was often the voice that spoke for the court. That voice embodied a restrained and cautious  approach to judging --deferential, where possible, to the other  elected branches of government, and loath to making broad pronouncements.  She was tough, bossy, relentless, and beneath that, she could be emotional. In private, she was not afraid to cry--and she had a soft spot for others when they needed it, according to Evan Thomas, author of O'Connor learned to be independent and to "suck it up" early in life. Home was her parents' cattle ranch, the second largest in Arizona, 160,000 acres, one-fifth the size of Rhode Island.It was "like our own country," she would say. But it was an unforgiving country with no heat and no running water.She was just 6 years old when her parents sent her four hours away by train to live with her less-than-warm-and-fuzzy grandmother in El Paso, Texas, so she could go to a good private school.She adored her father, and he gruffly loved her, too. But author Thomas says it was by watching her mother that she learned an important lesson — one that would guide her through life as she dealt with men and the world they dominated: Don't take the bait.O'Connor's father, known as DA, "could be harsh to his own wife," especially after a few drinks in the evening, "and what Sandra observed that was so valuable to her was that her mom did not take the bait. She learned how to roll with it," says Thomas. It was a lesson that served O'Connor well when she was elected to the Arizona state senate, a place that author Thomas describes as "a very male and very rough place for a woman in 1970."Not only did the men drink a lot, "sexual harassment was the order of the day." Usually O'Connor dealt with all that by just walking away. "She was not an arch-feminist," Thomas says. And, in relatively short order, O'Connor was elected majority leader.Still, sometimes enough was enough.One of those times involved Tom Goodwin, the chairman of the Arizona House Appropriations Committee. Thomas describes him as "a drunk-by-10:00 A.M. drunk." And when O'Connor finally confronted Goodwin about it, he snarled at her, "If you were a man, I'd punch you in the nose," to which she replied, "If you were a man, you could."She was "smarter than the men," and more organized, Thomas says. But after five years, she walked away from the legislature to become a state trial court judge.O'Connor served four years on the trial court, then two on an intermediate-level appeals court.Not exactly a springboard to the Supreme Court.But when Ronald Reagan, carrying out his campaign promise, wanted to name a woman to the high court for the first time, there weren't many conservative female judges to pick from. And O'Connor had friends in high places, among them Justice William Rehnquist, who had gone to Stanford Law School with her, courted her, and proposed to her — a fact not known even to the O'Connor and Rehnquist children until author Thomas unearthed their early correspondence.On July 7, 1981, President Reagan, after meeting privately with O'Connor, announced her nomination.Prepping for her confirmation hearing was daunting. She had no experience with constitutional law, or federal court practice. And she was cramming like mad."She had an amazing ability to absorb information quickly and retain it and go for what mattered," observes Thomas. "She could go through thousands of pages of dense, turgid legal stuff" and get to the point "in a hurry."The young Justice Department staffer assigned to help O'Connor was one John G. Roberts Jr., who would decades later become chief justice of the United States. But back then, he simply couldn't keep up with O'Connor; he was not able to get her the information she wanted fast enough.So she formed her own team in Arizona to supplement what she was receiving in Washington. She was, as author Thomas puts it, "a relentless grind." But at the confirmation hearings, the first ever to be broadcast, she was a sensation, answering questions deftly, knowledgeably and skillfully avoiding political potholes and trip wires on abortion and other controversial subjects.The public loved her, and she was confirmed 99 to 0.Much has been written about how terrified O'Connor was when she joined the Supreme Court. As she put it in an NPR interview, "Everyone said, 'Oh, we're so glad you're here now, just let me know if I can help.' I didn't even know the questions to ask to get the help I needed. ... We had more mail than we could even open." She knew that any misstep could be fatal for women's prospects all over the country. As she often put it, "It's good to be first, but you don't want to be last."Less well known is how exhilarated she was to be playing in the biggest and most exclusive legal league in the country, a place where she could make a difference.Also less known is the role she played in getting the court together. When she arrived, only four of the nine justices would show up for the justices' weekly lunches. And O'Connor set about to change that."She knew from her own experience that breaking bread together really is a way to get people to know each other, and she made it her business to make sure that the justices showed up for lunch," says author Thomas. "She would appear in their chambers and just sit there until they came with her."Perhaps her most difficult luncheon recruit was Clarence Thomas, who arrived in the fall of 1991 after a bruising confirmation battle involving charges of sexual harassment."On his very first day, Thomas, feeling glum and alone, is walking down the hall when O'Connor comes up to him and tells him, 'Those hearings were very harmful.' The next day she shows up again, and she says, 'You've got to come to lunch.' But he doesn't want to. He wants to be alone. The next day, she's back," reports author Thomas, and she says, " 'Clarence, you've got to come to lunch.' And finally he does. And he said, 'You know it made all the difference for me. I went from being lonely and alone to coming to lunch.' A little simple thing, but he joined the group because he realized that life has got to go on, this group has got to get along. She made him realize that."Indeed, the author quotes Thomas as telling him that O'Connor "was the glue ... that made this place civil."She stayed committed to this role throughout her entire career as an associate justice. She held her head high and would not let slights get to her. When Justice Antonin Scalia would write a dissenting opinion belittling her work, she refused to reply in kind, deleting the zingers that her clerks added to draft opinions in reply. A high class version of the lesson she learned from her mother: Don't take the bait. Her bout with breast cancer was the one time she almost buckled. "It terrified her and, briefly, she gave up. She did not want treatment, she did not want to try to beat it, she just accepted that she was going to die," Thomas says.This uncharacteristic bout of self-doubt lasted one day and then, as she always had, she sucked it up. She started going to exercise class; she never missed a day in court; she was out dancing within 10 days of surgery.Once again, O'Connor would be the lone woman on the court for 12 years. In 1993, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was appointed by President Clinton."The minute Justice Ginsburg arrived the media pressure was off, I think for both of us," O'Connor said in an NPR interview. "We just became two of the nine justices and it was just such a welcomed change, it was great."Though O'Connor was a pretty conservative justice, she was not doctrinaire. She  was a realist. On abortion, for example, she ultimately prevailed, cutting back on But at the same time, she held the line on the availability of abortion. When, for example, it came to a Pennsylvania law that required women to notify their husbands before getting an abortion, she said that was going too far. It is an "undue burden" on a woman's right to end a pregnancy."She came from the real world, and she knew that husbands could be abusive to their wives," author Thomas explains. Requiring a woman to tell a drunk or abusive husband that she was planning to have an abortion could end up with the woman badly beaten or worse. As Thomas says, "This wasn't a theoretical thing."She tried to weave a similarly realistic legal path on the subject of race and affirmative action. She didn't like racial preferences or identity politics. She wrote important opinions striking down racial apportionment in government contracting and in drawing legislative districts.But at the same time she believed that if the country was going to produce diverse leaders in law and politics and the military, colleges and universities had to be able to fashion admissions systems to bring in racial minorities in large enough numbers to reflect society at large. And so she ultimately wrote the opinion upholding affirmative action programs in higher education, but not quotas.These kinds of balancing tests are not embraced by today's brand of hardline conservative judges and legal theorists. They dismiss such decisions as unfaithful to the intentions of the founding fathers, and the proper role of the courts.O'Connor disagreed."She looked at the impact of the court on life, and that's what mattered to her more than some abstract judicial theory," author Thomas says. And retired Justice Stephen Breyer often observed that "Sandra had an innate sense of how much change the public could accept."Observers — conservative, moderate and liberal — agree on one aspect of Sandra Day O'Connor's service: She was the perfect first.  Or as one former law clerk observed, she was  "the un-feminist feminist.""Several people said to me that the irony here is that this somewhat traditional woman was more effective in the cause of women's rights precisely because she was not threatening and because she was practical and she knew when to step back. But she also knew when to step forward," author Thomas says.If she was triumphant in her Supreme Court career, however, she came to regret the end of that career on the court. The story of her decision to leave at the peak of her influence and ability is, by all accounts, tragic.Author Thomas sets the stage for what is to come in his book, noting that O'Connor for years kept up a relentless social schedule, partly for her husband John, who had been "a big-time lawyer" in Phoenix but was a professional second banana to his wife in Washington.She was able to switch roles, however, to be a more traditional wife at parties, where John O'Connor was often the star, as she sat back. He was famously entertaining, funny and charming, "a social lion" who could "show off" on the dance floor, too. So his wife kept up a sometimes frenetic social schedule for him, even though it meant she would return home late at night, to hours of work to complete.By the 2000s, though, John had begun to have memory problems. Early Alzheimer's turned into "raging" Alzheimer's, says Thomas. Soon the justice began bringing John with her to chambers every day, trying to personally care for him. But it got to the point where she realized she just couldn't do that. As Thomas puts it, "She said 'he sacrificed for me when we came here, now it's my turn.' "So she resigned from the court before she was ready. "It was tragic because within six months of her leaving the court, he could barely recognize her." And he ended up in an assisted-living facility where he formed an attachment to another woman, Thomas says.The newly retired Justice O'Connor would come in and find her husband holding hands with this other woman, and with her characteristic strength she would sit down and take her husband's other hand. It was a classic O'Connor solution to an impossible problem.With the knowledge of hindsight, O'Connor regretted her decision to leave the court, telling biographer Thomas it was "the biggest mistake, the dumbest thing I ever did."In the immediate aftermath of her retirement, she watched in dismay when President George W. Bush elevated Samuel Alito to replace her. Alito, when on a lower court, had specifically voted to uphold the Pennsylvania anti-abortion provision that required women to notify their husbands if they planned to get an abortion. Alito said that expert witness testimony failed to show how many women faced a real threat of battering if their abusive husbands learned of an abortion. But to O'Connor, Alito's view was not only dangerous to the safety of women living with  abusive spouses, and their children, it twisted her words to make the point he wanted.Once on the court Alito would, in fact, be a reliable conservative vote against abortion rights, ultimately writing the court's 2022 decision reversing the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Alito's appointment would immediately  provide a fifth vote for a new and much more conservative court majority that would overturn or undermine other decisions O'Connor was proud of — including decisions that she wrote that had upheld campaign finance reform. Watching this prompted O'Connor to lament privately,  that the new court was "systematically dismantling my legacy." In 2018 O'Connor announced that she had dementia and that she was withdrawing from public life. But she had good days, and sometimes, when friends or family would tell her about the high court's  dramatic turn to the right,  she would mutter, "that's a mistake."

topic type: National

content:Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the court, died Friday in Phoenix, Ariz., of complications related to advanced dementia, probably Alzheimer's, and a respiratory illness, the court announced. She was 93 years old.O'Connor was appointed to the court by President Reagan in 1981 and retired in 2006, after serving more than 24 years on the court.O'Connor served on the court for a quarter of a century and, after that, became an outspoken critic of what she saw as modern threats to judicial independence, particularly the election of state judges, which she believed eroded independent judicial decision-making, and public confidence in the courts. While on the court, O'Connor was called "the most powerful woman in America." Because of her position at the center of a court that was so closely divided on so many major questions, she often cast the deciding vote in cases involving abortion, affirmative action, national security, campaign finance reform, separation of church and state, and states' rights, as well as in the case that decided the 2000 election, Her retirement allowed President George W. Bush to appoint a much more conservative justice, Samuel Alito, in her place, and that appointment took the court in a far more conservative direction.O'Connor's retirement was the last step in a long balancing act between family and career. In 2005, O'Connor's husband was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and when the ailing Chief Justice William Rehnquist told her that he was putting off his retirement, O'Connor decided that with her husband's health declining, she could not wait and risk the possibility that the court would have two vacancies at once.As it turned out, that's what happened anyway. O'Connor announced her retirement, and the chief justice died weeks later. She stayed on for another six months while confirmation hearings proceeded, and in a cruel twist of fate, her husband's health took such a precipitous downward turn that he had to be placed in a home, and later died.But on that June day in 2005 when O'Connor announced her retirement, she wept; she later made quite clear that she regretted the decision to step down. She went on to lead a multifaceted life, crisscrossing the United States and the rest of the world, crusading against threats to judicial independence and advocating for more civics instruction in public schools to teach students about the structure of the U.S. government.Born in Texas, O'Connor spent her early life riding horses and roping steers At age 10, she was sent away to school in El Paso, and at age 16 she enrolled at Stanford, eventually graduating from law school third in her class.On the job market, she soon learned nobody wanted to hire a female lawyer. After every job door was closed in her face, a desperate O'Connor finally made an offer to the San Mateo County attorney, an offer that she hoped he couldn't refuse."I wrote him a very long letter explaining all the reasons why I thought that I would be helpful to him in the office and offering to work for nothing, if that was necessary," O'Connor said in 2003 interview with NPR.In the beginning it was indeed necessary; she worked for free and she even shared office space with the county attorney's secretary. But she soon was put on salary, and when she and her husband, John, moved to Arizona, she continued practicing law, stopping only when a dearth of babysitters forced a five-year hiatus to raise her three sons.Soon she was a figure to be reckoned with in Arizona's political life. Elected to the state Senate, she quickly rose in Republican ranks to become the majority leader, and then was appointed a state trial judge and a state appellate court judge. By then, it was 1981, and with the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart, President Ronald Reagan had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill.Stewart's imminent retirement was known to only a few inside the administration, and there was initially something of a battle over whether the president should fulfill his campaign promise to appoint a woman.Kenneth Starr, then an assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, recalls that staff aides examined Reagan's campaign words carefully, noting that he had not made an iron-clad pledge. Some administration insiders urged the president to use this first appointment to name Robert Bork or some other conservative luminary to the high court. But that was not to be."Reagan was not a word parser, and he felt that he had made a moral commitment to appoint a qualified woman to the Supreme Court, that it was long overdue ... and that's what our marching orders were," Starr said in an interview with NPR.But back then, the list of qualified women with any conservative credentials at all was a short one. Starr believes that O'Connor's name was first suggested by then-Justice Rehnquist, a fellow Arizonan and a classmate of O'Connor's at Stanford. When O'Connor was spirited to the White House for an interview with Reagan, the two Westerners had an immediate rapport, and O'Connor soon won the nod.O'Connor later acknowledged that her appointment was an "affirmative act" — that she was not among the most qualified judges or scholars back then. But still, she won quick confirmation.Once on the court, O'Connor's main concern, she later said, was whether she could do the job. If she stumbled badly, she said, it would make life much more difficult for women.As it turned out, of course, O'Connor's appointment gave a huge boost to women in the law."The minute I was confirmed and on the court, states across the country started putting more women ... on their Supreme Courts," O'Connor said. "And it made a difference in the acceptance of young women as lawyers. It opened doors for them."In the years that followed, O'Connor's impact on the law would be enormous. On the court, she became part of a conservative states' rights majority, voting, for example, to strike down key portions of the Brady gun control law.On the subject of racial discrimination and affirmative action, O'Connor was "Such diversity promotes learning and better prepares students for an increasingly heterogeneous workforce, for responsible citizenship, and for the legal profession," O'Connor said then.In each of the race cases, O'Connor followed a well-trodden path for her: decide the case before you, make as few broad and sweeping rules as possible, and leave the door open for future change in a different set of circumstances.In 2004, she walked a similar careful line as author of the key decision on the president's power to detain enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Repudiating the Bush administration's position, she declared that even in wartime, the president does not have a "blank check" allowing him to indefinitely detain American citizens without charge and without a chance to rebut the government's allegations of wrongdoing."We conclude that a citizen detainee seeking to challenge his classification as an enemy combatant must receive ... a fair opportunity to rebut the government's factual assertions before a neutral decision-maker," O'Connor said when she announced the court's decision in In no area, though, was O'Connor more careful — and successful — at carving out a middle ground than on questions involving abortion. When she joined the court, a woman's right to an abortion was spelled out in Six years later, she deprived the court's four conservatives of a fifth vote to overturn "Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that can't control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code," O'Connor said in June of 1992 when she announced the court's decision in Eight years later, O'Connor provided the fifth and deciding vote on abortion, this time invalidating a so-called partial birth abortion law because it provided no exception to preserve the health of the mother, and thus imposed an undue burden. Within a year of her departure from the court, however, a new, more conservative court majority reached the opposite conclusion and upheld a federal ban on so-called partial birth abortions. It was a pattern that was to repeat itself in other areas of the law after O'Connor left.When she was appointed to the Supreme Court, O'Connor knew she would be a role model for women. She persevered even through a bout with breast cancer. For a year, she wore a wig, looked drained and wan, but never missed a court day.She presided over a period in American law when women moved from being anomalies in the courtroom to the majority of the graduates in many major American law schools.

Inside the administration, there was a battle over whether the president should fulfill his campaign promise to appoint a woman or take the opportunity to appoint Robert Bork or some other conservative luminary. Kenneth Starr, then a top aide to the attorney general, reveals what happened.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KENNETH STARR: President Reagan was not a word parser, and he felt that he had made a moral commitment to appoint a qualified woman to the Supreme Court, that it was long overdue, etc. And that's what our marching orders were.TOTENBERG: Starr believes that O'Connor's name was first suggested by then Justice Rehnquist, a fellow Arizonan and classmate of O'Connor's at Stanford. O'Connor was spirited to the White House for an interview with President Reagan. The two Westerners had an immediate rapport, and the Arizona judge soon won the nod.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: So today, I'm pleased to announce that upon completion of all the necessary checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I will send to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor of Arizona Court of Appeals for confirmation as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. She is truly a person for all seasons.TOTENBERG: O'Connor later acknowledged that her appointment was a, quote, "affirmative act," that she was not among the most qualified judges or scholars, but she won quick confirmation. Once on the court, O'Connor's main concern, she later said, was whether she could do the job. "If I stumbled badly," she said, "it would make life much more difficult for women." As it turned out, of course, O'Connor's appointment gave a huge boost to women in the law.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O’CONNOR: The minute I was confirmed and on the court, states across the country started putting more women on their supreme courts, and it made a difference in the acceptance of young women as lawyers. It opened doors for them.TOTENBERG: In the years that followed, O'Connor's impact on the law would be enormous. On the court, she became part of a conservative state's rights majority, voting, for example, to strike down key portions of the Brady gun control law. On the subject of racial discrimination and affirmative action, O'Connor was the key vote limiting affirmative action for minority contractors and curtailing the use of race to create majority Black legislative districts. But in 2003, she wrote the court's opinion declaring that colleges and universities are justified in using race as a factor in college and graduate school admissions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O’CONNOR: Such diversity promotes learning and better prepares students for an increasingly heterogeneous workforce, for responsible citizenship and for the legal profession.TOTENBERG: In each of the race cases, O'Connor followed a well-trodden path for her. Decide the case before you, make as few broad and sweeping rules as possible and leave the door open for future change in a different set of circumstances. In 2004, she walked a similar careful line as author of the key decision on the president's detention powers at Guantanamo. Repudiating the Bush administration's position, she declared that even in wartime, the president does not have a blank check.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O’CONNOR: Due process demands that a United States citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant must be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decision maker.TOTENBERG: Tape of those opinion announcements were provided by the OEA (ph) Project. In no area, though, was O'Connor more careful and successful at carving out a middle ground than on questions involving abortion. When she joined the court, a woman's right to an abortion was spelled out in Roe v. Wade as relatively absolute. But less than two years after becoming a justice, O'Connor dissented from a major extension of Roe, saying that in her view, a state could regulate abortions unless those regulations imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to choose. Nearly a decade later, her compromise position finally prevailed.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O’CONNOR: Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. We reaffirm the constitutionally protected liberty of the woman to decide to have an abortion before the fetus attains viability, and to obtain it without undue interference from the state.TOTENBERG: When she was appointed to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor knew she would be a role model for women. She persevered even through a bout with breast cancer. For a year, she wore a wig, looked drained and wan but never missed a court date. She presided over a period in American law when women moved from being anomalies in the courtroom to the majority of graduates at many major American law schools. And she left a profound mark on the history of the Supreme Court and the nation.Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.(SOUNDBITE OF SLOWDIVE'S "PRAYER REMEMBERED")
        Dec. 1st, 2023In the audio, as in a previous version of the web story, we incorrectly say Justice O'Connor was born in Arizona. She was born in El Paso, Texas.

tile: The DeSantis-Newsom 'debate' offered a window into the future of warring visions of America
topic type: Elections
written by: By Domenico Montanaro
date: 12/01/2023
content:Lincoln-Douglas this was not — though either man would likely eagerly embrace even being mentioned in the same sentence.There was a political debate Thursday night in Georgia, but not between two presidential candidates. Instead, it was between one governor and presidential candidate and another governor, who some think might be one.On the one side, there was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is of course running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. It sure looked like a presidential debate. There were two politicians at lecterns, a moderator, even a whole set made to look like one.But this was a product of TV, specifically of Fox News and host Sean Hannity. Newsom gained attention some months ago for a peppy interview with Hannity. Hannity seemed to enjoy the back and forth, and the duo formed an unlikely And so this event was birthed. What did we learn?The California governor hasn't been shy about making a case for a left-of-center vision for the country. His pearly whites and Pat Riley hair haven't seemed to meet a camera they haven't liked.It has led to speculation that Newsom is really running a shadow campaign, waiting in the wings in case President Biden doesn't actually run for reelection — despite the fact that Biden is already doing exactly that.Newsom tried to dismiss — again — that notion early and often in Thursday night's debate."There are profound differences tonight, and I'm happy to engage them," Newsom said, "but one thing we do have in common is neither of us will be the nominee of our party in 2024."As he's done in all of his other public events and interviews this year, Newsom defended Biden, but some — even in his own party — still don't buy the loyal surrogate act."There are two additional Democrats running for ... president right now," Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, said earlier this month — ironically from the early caucus state of Iowa. "One is a congressman from Minnesota, the other one is the governor of California, but only one has the guts to announce it."The congressman from Minnesota being Rep. Dean Phillips."I appreciate and respect the work the president is doing," Newsom said during the debate, adding, "I don't know how many times I can say it. They're just making this stuff up about a shadow campaign."The reality is, Newsom has thrust himself into the conversation for the presidency. If he's not angling to run this cycle, as he says, he certainly appears to be doing so for 2028 — when the country is set to be clear of Trump and Biden.Time is running out for DeSantis. He's It's not clear he did enough with this appearance to help himself close the gap, though his team was happy with his performance and cited dozens of conservative commentators who praised him.DeSantis' task was made tougher, though, because Newsom didn't just want to have a debate on which of theirs is a better governing philosophy, but also seemed intent on trying to tank DeSantis' campaign."Joe Biden will be our nominee in a matter of weeks," Newsom said, "and in a matter of weeks, Sean, he'll be endorsing Donald Trump as the nominee for the Republican Party."At another point, this: "When are you going to drop out and at least give Nikki Haley a shot to take down Donald Trump in his nomination. She laid you out."Newsom clearly seemed to be trying to get under DeSantis' skin — and he appeared to do so at times.At one point, as both men were talking over each other and the volume got louder, Newsom played his best Joe Cool, threw his hands open, turned to DeSantis and said with a smile, "Hey, Ron, relax."Aside from the jabs, DeSantis went after Newsom on his record as California governor. And it was a friendly environment for DeSantis to do so. The topics seemed to benefit his point of view, not unexpectedly, considering the platform. They ranged from: You get the idea.With that wind at his back, and on a conservative platform, DeSantis was more than happy to contrast his state with Newsom's. The "California liberal" reputation is going to be a hurdle for Newsom, if he does decide to run at some point. And DeSantis got in a dig — with some family ties."I was talking to a fella who had made the move from California to Florida," DeSantis said before setting up his punch line. "He was telling me that Florida's much better governed, safer, better budget, lower taxes, then he paused and said, 'By the way, I'm Gavin Newsom's father-in-law.' " Zing.Newsom's father-in-law, Kenneth F. Siebel Jr., is an investment manager and longtime GOP donor, according to a DeSantis stressed that Biden, whom he wants to take on in next year's general election, wants to replicate the California model for the nation.Newsom was quick to counter, charging that Florida's tax system hurts working people, that DeSantis bullies the marginalized and that women's reproductive rights are under assault because of Florida's six-week abortion ban. "He's lying to you about all these facts and figures," DeSantis charged, "throwing stuff out to see what sticks to the wall. This is a slippery, slick politician."DeSantis also provocatively went after Newsom on the debate about books in schools and, as he called it, the uncleanliness of California's cities. He brought on stage with him, and displayed for the cameras, what appeared to be a page from a graphic novel with partially blacked-out images showing sexual acts that he claimed is in California schools, as well as a map of, well, poop that he said is from an app depicting parts of San Francisco.There couldn't be two more ideologically opposite philosophies on how to govern than DeSantis' Florida and Newsom's California.If you're a conservative, you likely hold up California as everything that's wrong with America — as outlined in the topics presented. But if you're left of center, you likely see DeSantis and his governance as abhorrent.That probably didn't change if you watched this debate. In the end, neither man may be elected president in 2024, but this could be a preview of the next presidential cycle, when the country is past Trump and Biden, and there is the chance for an American political rebirth when candidates will have to debate — on an actual presidential debate stage — their starkly different for their visions of America in a clash of governing ideologies.

topic type: Law
written by: By Ryan Lucas
date: 12/01/2023
content:Former President Donald Trump is not immune from being sued over the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, a federal appeals court ruled Friday, clearing the way for lawsuits filed against him in connection with the deadly riot.The ruling from a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stems from several lawsuits brought by Capitol Police officers and Democratic members of Congress seeking civil damages from Trump related to the events of Jan. 6, 2021.Trump has sought to have the cases dismissed, arguing in part that as president he enjoyed absolute immunity from civil lawsuits. The question before the appeals court was whether Trump's actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, and on the day itself were official acts of the presidency and indeed shielded from liability.In its ruling, the court said the answer, for now, is no.The president, said Judge Sri Srinivasan in the written opinion, "does not spend every minute of every day exercising official responsibilities. And when he acts outside the functions of his office, he does not continue to enjoy immunity from damages liability just because he happens to be the President."A first-term president's reelection campaign, the opinion said, is not an official presidential act."He is acting as an officer-Trump has tried to argue that a president's speech on a matter of public concern, such as allegations of vote fraud, should be considered an official act of the president.The court rejected that argument."When a sitting president running for re-election speaks in a campaign ad, that is usually on a matter of public concern. Yet he does so in an unofficial, private capacity as office-seeker, not an official capacity as office-holder," the opinion said. "Actions taken in an A Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The court's ruling is not necessarily the final say on this question. The opinion itself leaves the door open for Trump to raise similar challenges — and demonstrate he was indeed acting in his official capacity — as the lawsuits proceed at the District Court level.Trump also could appeal Friday's ruling.The former president has made a similar presidential immunity claim regarding the criminal prosecution he's facing, brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in connection with Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The District Court has yet to rule on Trump's motion in that case.

topic type: Elections
written by: By Hansi Lo Wang
date: 12/01/2023
content:Republican state officials are The officials cite It's the latest legal development in a long-running redistricting fight that could help determine which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives after next year's elections.The state's request to the full 5th Circuit threatens to delay the complicated process for getting in place a redistricting plan that is in line with the Voting Rights Act in time for the 2024 elections.A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit had given the Louisiana legislature until Jan. 15, 2024, to draw a new congressional map after concluding a lower court correctly ruled that the previous map likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of the state's Black voters.This week, the lower court judge Still, the panel found that the lower court "did not clearly err in its necessary fact-findings nor commit legal error" in finding the map approved by the state's Republican-controlled legislature to be a likely violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.Out of that map's six congressional districts, there is only one where Black Louisianans — who make up close to a third of the state's population — have a realistic opportunity to elect their preferred candidate. That candidate would likely be a Democrat because of how racially polarized voting is in the southern state.The appeals court panel's ruling notes that if the state legislature does not pass a new map in January, the lower court should move ahead to a trial in order to finalize a map in time for the 2024 elections. Any major delays could risk not having a redistricting plan in place by late May, when the state has said it needs a final map to prepare for elections.After the ruling's release, Landry said he plans to call a special session as governor. "Redistricting is a state legislative function. Based on today's ruling, I will call for a special session so our Legislature may resolve this issue," Landry said in an emailed statement on Nov. 10.But Landry is not set to be inaugurated until Jan. 8. And if he calls a special session on his inauguration day, The state's outgoing Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, could call a session before leaving office. On the day the 5th Circuit panel released its ruling, Edwards said in a statement that Louisiana "can and should have a congressional map that represents our voting population, which is one-third Black.""This is about simple math, basic fairness, and the rule of law," Edwards added. "With the 5th Circuit's action today, I remain confident that we will have a fair map with two majority Black districts before the congressional elections next year."But on Thursday, Eric Holl, a spokesperson for the governor, confirmed in an email that Edwards is not planning to call a special session to draw new maps because "the new governor and legislature will now have time to meet the deadline."The U.S. Supreme Court was recently asked to review a separate 5th Circuit panel's ruling that canceled a hearing about redrawing the map. The court denied an emergency request to revive that hearing and speed up the redrawing process.This case is one of several in the South where Republican state officials are trying to argue that the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 is no longer constitutional. Section 2 is a key remaining part of the landmark law after Supreme Court rulings weakened many of its provisions over the past decade. The effort against Section 2 is trying to push federal courts to reinterpret long-standing legal protections against racial discrimination in redistricting.In a similar congressional redistricting case out of Alabama, however, the Supreme Court ruled in June to uphold its past rulings on Section 2 and allowed a lower court to put in place

topic type: Law
written by: None
date: 12/01/2023
content:An incarcerated former gang member and one-time FBI informant was charged Friday with attempted murder in the stabbing of ex-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin at a federal prison in Arizona.John Turscak stabbed Chauvin 22 times at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson and said he would have killed Chauvin had correctional officers not responded so quickly, federal prosecutors said.Turscak, serving a 30-year sentence for crimes committed while a member of the Mexican Mafia gang, told investigators he thought about attacking Chauvin for about a month because the former officer, convicted of murdering George Floyd, is a high-profile inmate, prosecutors said. Turscak later denied wanting to kill Chauvin, prosecutors said.Turscak is accused of attacking Chauvin with an improvised knife in the prison's law library around 12:30 p.m. on Nov. 24, the day after Thanksgiving. The Bureau of Prisons said employees stopped the attack and performed "life-saving measures." Chauvin was taken to a hospital for treatment.Turscak told FBI agents interviewing him after the assault that he attacked Chauvin on Black Friday as a symbolic connection to the Black Lives Matter movement, which garnered widespread support in the wake of Floyd's death, and the "Black Hand" symbol associated with the Mexican Mafia, prosecutors said.Turscak, 52, is also charged with assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury. The attempted murder and assault with intent to commit murder charges are each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. He is scheduled to complete his current sentence in 2026.A lawyer for Turscak was not listed in court records. Turscak has represented himself from prison in numerous court matters. After the stabbing, he was moved to an adjacent federal penitentiary in Tucson, where he remained in custody on Friday, inmate records show.Messages seeking comment were left with Chauvin's lawyers.Chauvin, 47, was sent to FCI Tucson from a maximum-security Minnesota state prison in August 2022 to simultaneously serve a 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyd's civil rights and a 22½-year state sentence for second-degree murder.Chauvin's lawyer at the time, Eric Nelson, had advocated for keeping him out of general population and away from other inmates, anticipating he would be a target. In Minnesota, Chauvin was mainly kept in solitary confinement "largely for his own protection," Nelson wrote in court papers last year.Floyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9½ minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.Bystander video captured Floyd's fading cries of "I can't breathe." His death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.Turscak led a faction of the Mexican Mafia in the Los Angeles area in the late 1990s, going by the nickname "Stranger," according to court records. He became an FBI informant in 1997, providing information about the gang and recordings of conversations he had with other Mexican Mafia members and associates.The investigation led to more than 40 indictments. But about midway through, the FBI dropped Turscak as an informant because he was still dealing drugs, extorting money and authorizing assaults. According to court papers, Turscak plotted attacks on rival gang members and was accused of attempting to kill a leader of a rival Mexican Mafia faction while also being targeted himself.Turscak pleaded guilty in 2001 to racketeering and conspiring to kill a gang rival. He said he thought his cooperation with the FBI would have earned a lighter sentence."I didn't commit those crimes for kicks," Turscak said, according to news reports about his sentencing. "I did them because I had to if I wanted to stay alive. I told that to the FBI agents and they just said, 'Do what you have to do."'

tile: These penguins take 10,000 little naps a day — seconds at a time
topic type: Short Wave
written by: By Regina G. Barber, Aaron Scott, Brent Baughman
date: 12/01/2023
content:Sleep. It's an essential biological function that has long intrigued scientists. Similar to the book But scientists did just that with wild chinstrap penguins in Antarctica. In doing so, researchers found birds in the nesting colony took over ten thousand microsleeps throughout the day – amounting to a whopping 11 hours of sleep. Their work was published Thursday in the journal Researchers found that the microsleeps last mere seconds. Researchers think that being able to sleep for such short intervals might help the animals avoid predators that might be more likely to strike if the penguins were asleep for longer — especially considering that one parent goes out feeding in the ocean for days, leaving the other parent to protect the eggs from predatory birds.Microsleep is much shorter than the minutes-long micronaps that have been shown to Although this study isn't a collective win for human sleep, the research is still a data collection win for human researchers. To study the penguins, scientists implanted devices into a small group of penguins' brain and neck muscles. These brain wave and location data coupled with filming these birds in the nest gave robust sleep data. The equipment had never been used before, so this data collection was only supposed to be a test. However, the process went so well, the data was published in this study. The study is an early insight into a relatively large vacuum of scientific knowledge about sleep. "Pretty much every study on sleeping birds discovers something new, something we didn't know about before," says Libourel.EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: You're listening to SHORT WAVE from NPR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)AARON SCOTT, HOST:  Hey, SHORT WAVErs, Aaron Scott here.REGINA BARBER, HOST:  With me, Regina Barber.SCOTT: And for our regular roundup of science news, the one, the only Mary Louise Kelly is here as well.MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Woo-hoo. Glad to be back with you. Thanks for letting me come by.SCOTT: Mary Louise, as always, we're going to share three science stories in the news that have caught our attention recently.BARBER: Yeah. We've got a story about microscopic robots made from human cells. We've got a story about one animal that takes micronaps, like thousands of them, each day.SCOTT: And finally, a story about another animal that was thought to be extinct but is very much alive.KELLY: Wow. You had me at micronaps, (laughter) which sounds great because I never get them. Go on.BARBER: Yes, I totally understand. But you can catch a few winks now and we'll tell you more in just a minute on this episode of SHORT WAVE, the science podcast from NPR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCOTT: All right, Mary Louise, you're our guest. Which topic would you like to start with?KELLY: Well, as I mentioned, I'm leaning toward the micronaps, but I will be disciplined and start with robots. You told me these are tiny healing robots made from human cells, and I'm not sure I even understand what that means (laughter).SCOTT: Yeah, so it's one human cell that has been reprogrammed to grow into a little multicellular ball. And what's new about these balls is they can move around on their own and actually help heal human tissue. The researchers are calling them anthrobots.KELLY: Anthrobots, OK. And how does this work? How did they make them?SCOTT: Yeah, so they started with cells from an adult trachea, you know, the windpipe, because these cells have these little hairlike things called cilia on one side. And that's what kind of waves around and pushes out particles and germs and ultimately allows us to expel the gunk of, you know, when we cough or clear our throats.BARBER: And they figured out a way to grow single trachea cells into multicellular balls with cilia on the outside. So the cilia acts like oars, pushing them along. And some of these anthrobots went in a straight line, others moved in circles, some wiggled in place.KELLY: They wiggled?(LAUGHTER)KELLY: That's kind of cute. But more importantly, you said they can actually - they can heal cells?BARBER: Yeah, that was the surprise. So just to explore, they took layers of neurons, which notoriously are cells that don't heal well, and they scratched a gap through it to mimic a wound. And then they put some of anthrobots in that gap.SCOTT: And some of the bots, simply just by bridging that gap, actually helped the neural tissue heal and the gap closed. The researchers don't quite understand why this happened, especially since these cells aren't genetically modified to heal or anything. So this was really kind of an exciting, unexpected finding.KELLY: Yeah. And how would this be used in medicine?SCOTT: Yeah, so I talked with the lead researcher, Gizem Gumuskaya, who published this study this week in the journal Advanced Science. And she says in the future, these anthrobots could be programmed to do everything from patrol the body looking for tumors to treating arteries clogged with plaque.GIZEM GUMUSKAYA: So maybe, you know, as the anthrobot is moving through the artery, it encounters this plaque. And then in return, it turns on its cilia sort of at a much faster rate to bulldoze through that plaque and then clear it in that way.BARBER: Yeah. And one of the key things is that the anthrobots could be made from the patient's own cells. So in theory, there's a lot fewer side effects than drugs or other forms of therapy.KELLY: Got it. OK, that's fascinating. OK, from microscopic robots to the next story, about micronapping. This is a penguin that takes thousands of little naps every day. I love this story so much already.BARBER: Yeah, actually, 10,000 times. That's how many times they're kind of having this microsleep. So a study published in Science this past week found that chinstrap penguins during breeding season utilize microsleep, which is seconds long, to get over 11 hours of sleep a day. This is while living in a super noisy, hectic nesting colony.SCOTT: And this is the first time a species has been shown to have this extremely fragmented sleep over long periods of time, which is necessary for penguins because one parent goes out feeding in the ocean for days and leaves the other parent to protect the eggs from predatory birds. And so that means that remaining parent needs to be constantly vigilant, and it seems like it does that by hacking naps.KELLY: Totally. I would love to do this. I would love to take thousands of micronaps all day long.SCOTT: (Laughter).KELLY: So what about humans? Can we learn anything from the chinstrap penguin?SCOTT: Yeah, so there is research in humans that shows that micronaps can help with memory and that midday naps might be great for young, healthy people. But those human naps are all being measured in minutes, while these penguins - we are talking about just a few seconds.BARBER: Right. And I talked to one of the study researchers, Paul-Antoine Libourel. And he wants us to be very cautious about making these human comparisons.PAUL-ANTOINE LIBOUREL: This is not related to human physiology. And this won't tell us more about the function of sleep.KELLY: Sorry, sorry. Nodded off for a second there, a little micro-nap.(LAUGHTER)SCOTT: Do not pull a penguin on us, Mary Louise.KELLY: Back with you fully now. And I do want to ask...BARBER: We can't sustain those, you know?KELLY: (Laughter) Indeed. Sadly. How did they figure this out? How do you go about collecting data to figure out the penguins are napping so many times a day?SCOTT: So they built these little sleep logger devices that would measure the penguins' brainwaves. And this was actually only supposed to be a trial run for the devices. But Paul-Antoine said that catching the penguins and putting on the devices and then retrieving them went so well that they were able to gather enough data to publish this paper.BARBER: Yeah, and they did all of this in the penguins' natural habitat, which is a big deal because what little we know about sleep is from controlled settings. But how an animal sleeps in a lab doesn't tell us how it sleeps in the wild, like, where sleep evolved. This study really advances sleep research, even if it doesn't help us humans with our sleep for now.KELLY: Let's roll wide awake into the third and final story you have brought us. This is another animal, one that was thought to be extinct for decades by scientists. However, it was recently filmed for the first time by researchers at Oxford University. Tell all.BARBER: Yeah, and the animal is - drumroll - the Attenborough's long-beaked echidna.KELLY: The Attenborough's. OK, I'm going to guess that's David Attenborough, the famous British naturalist.BARBER: Yeah.KELLY: And then what was the rest of the name?BARBER: Echidna.SCOTT: Yeah. And I would encourage you to Google one. They look like a cross between an anteater and a porcupine. And there's a few different types of echidnas. But this one, Attenborough's long-beaked echidna, was rediscovered by scientists on an expedition this past summer in the Indonesian part of the island of New Guinea.BARBER: Yeah, our colleague Emma Bowman wrote about this discovery for NPR. It really is something. Like, scientists on this expedition set up 80 different cameras for a month in an area where they've seen clues of the echidna. Here's the biologist who led the expedition, James Kempton.JAMES KEMPTON: It was the very last images from the final camera that we collected on the final day of the last ascent of the expedition. Those were the images of the echidna. And I ran into the living room of base camp and shouted, we found it. We found it.BARBER: And that was the first proof of the animal anyone had seen since 1961.KELLY: Since 1961. You can hear the excitement in his voice.BARBER: Yeah.KELLY: I mean, I'm excited. I've never heard of this animal, but I'm excited. Why is this so exciting for scientists?SCOTT: Yeah, well, to start out, I'm going to tell you why this is so exciting to me. And it's because a baby echidna is called a puggle, Mary Louise.KELLY: Aww.SCOTT: A puggle.KELLY: (Laughter) OK.BARBER: OK. But a big reason this animal is exciting to scientists is that this long-beaked echidna is part of a small subgroup of mammals that include platypuses that lay eggs.SCOTT: So they represent this evolutionary split that occurred more than 200 million years ago, when they diverge from the common ancestors of other mammals. Here's James Kempton again.KEMPTON: And that's why it's so important because it's another guardian of this unique and fragile evolutionary history, which if it were to be lost, would be an absolute tragedy.SCOTT: Mary Louise Kelly, thank you for hanging out, as always.BARBER: Thank you so much.KELLY: My total pleasure. Anytime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SCOTT: Before we head out, we want to take a minute to say thank you so much to our SHORT WAVE+ supporters and anyone listening who donates to public media. I mean, public media by definition means that you, the public, support it.BARBER: Everything you hear from NPR network really does depend on your contributions.

tile: The iceberg cometh: It's the size of Oahu, and it's moving into the open ocean
topic type: Environment
written by: By Bill Chappell
date: 12/01/2023
content:Ships plying the frigid waters near the Antarctic Peninsula, south of South America, will need to keep an eye on their radar for a floating island of ice: "The largest iceberg in the world, A-23a, is on the move into open ocean!" as the British Antarctic Survey "It's a trillion tons of ice. So it's hard to comprehend just how big a patch of ice this is," Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the Iceberg A23a measures 40 by 32 nautical miles, according to the When A23a was still part of an ice shelf, it held a Soviet research station — and it whisked that base off to sea when it floated away in the 1980s (more on that below). The iceberg then became grounded on the seafloor. But in recent years, it has been on the move again, after shaking loose.Here's a quick recap of the iceberg, its history and its potential future:A23a hasn't always held the title. In 2021, for instance, it was supplanted by iceberg A-76, which "It's truly a gargantuan piece of ice," Scambos said, noting that the iceberg is likely 1,000 to 1,200 feet thick.Its roots stretch to the austral winter of 1986, when the If icebergs were humans, A23a would be a millennial. And like members of that generation who have sometimes been forced to stay home by harsh economic conditions, the iceberg has spent most of its independent existence grounded, stuck to a sandbank in shallow waters.Little by little, the iceberg kept scouring a path over the seafloor and toward deeper water, nudged by currents, the wind and other factors. A breakthrough came in 2020, when the main bulk of A23a freed itself and Over the decades, the Filchner Ice Shelf has hosted several countries' research and mapping stations. For about 10 years, that included a Soviet station called Druzhnaya 1."When the A23 iceberg calved and floated off" in 1986, "Druzhnaya 1 was still on it," according to the In February 1987, a Soviet ship, the Kapitan Kondratyev, tracked the iceberg down and deployed a landing party aboard a helicopter "to salvage the most valuable equipment from the station," as researchers noted in a If you were to set foot on A23a, Scambos said, you likely wouldn't realize it's an iceberg, floating loose at sea. Its scale would simply fill the horizon; any movement would be imperceptible. He should know. He has camped on icebergs before.He recalls one odd thing: the disorientation."The ice that the base was built on would start to rotate, and that would make the sun do funny things in the sky," Scambos said. "It wouldn't be where it's supposed to be in the morning or in the evening or at night — even though it's 24 hours of daylight."Over the years, he has heard from people who want to visit an iceberg. And Scambos says that while some of their goals were outlandish (as in, people hoping to declare unilateral sovereignty over an ice kingdom), a gigantic iceberg like A23a is pretty stable — with a big caveat."It's not impossible to land on it," Scambos said. "I mean, the upper surface is going to be smooth and snowy and relatively safe, at least for now."But as the iceberg drifts north and finds warmer conditions, melting and flooding will begin."Eventually it will start to crack apart fairly rapidly towards the end," he said. "You wouldn't want to be on it at the end, because the whole thing would be breaking off in pieces and falling into the ocean."Most icebergs emerging from the Weddell Sea tend to drift slightly eastward toward South Georgia, If that happens to A23a, it could run aground again near South Georgia. But other icebergs, like its sibling A24, have moved more directly north, toward the Falkland Islands."Usually they're in the process of breaking up at that point," Scambos said, "although this one is likely to survive longer than most because it came from a colder part of Antarctica" and is thick, along with having a heavy buildup of snowfall.If A23a doesn't get hung up in shallow and warmer waters, he added, "it could wind up drifting south of Africa into the Indian Ocean. They've even drifted all the way into the Pacific and wound up coming up on Chile, almost circumnavigating the globe. Some of the largest icebergs have done that in the past."Massive icebergs like A23a scrape and scour the seafloor in shallow waters."There's a lot of life that lives in the bottom of the ocean that is just completely crushed, wrecked, when one of these things passes over," Scambos said. "That's it for the ecosystem that lives in that part of the ocean."But the icebergs also give scientists an idea of the changes wrought when massive plates of ice, formed in the coldest parts of the world, suddenly find themselves in warmer conditions."The main scientific source of interest for the iceberg is sampling ocean surface waters behind, near, and just ahead of it," Em Newton of the British Antarctic Survey said of A23a, in a message to NPR. Researchers, she added, want "to understand the effects of temperature, changes to salinity, released nutrients, etc., along its path."This part of the Southern Ocean is normally very poor in nutrients. An iceberg like A23a, Scambos says, can help change that by shedding nutrients it accumulated from Antarctica and stirring up deep water, possibly sparking a plankton bloom in its wake.News of the iceberg's peregrination comes after "In February 2023, sea ice around Antarctica reached the And in September, researchers at the "But despite several recent years of low extents, the Scambos agrees, noting that A23a came from a part of Antarctica that is fairly stable."These big icebergs are spectacular, but they're just the way Antarctica works. This is how an ice sheet works. It gathers snow, and the snow thickens and flows off into the ocean, and then pieces break off. And in Antarctica, those pieces are really, really large," he said."But the more important thing for people to be aware of is that Antarctica in other places is losing ice very rapidly," Scambos said, describing a dynamic that "And that actually is a much more serious problem."

written by: By Eleanor Beardsley
date: 12/01/2023
content:RE'IM, Israel — In a small clearing in a eucalyptus forest, a lone DJ on a stage blasts out pulsing electronic music that punctuates the otherwise quiet landscape.There are no concertgoers. His crowd is a sea of poster-board faces atop poles. These are the faces of the 364 young people killed by Hamas-led militants last month in an attack on a rave party in Israel's Negev Desert. There are also pictures of dozens of people Hamas seized as hostages that same day.The memorial event took place Tuesday at the exact spot of the Nova festival massacre, to commemorate those whose lives were cut short and upended on Oct. 7, when Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities."It's just our small way to tell the world what happened here," says Ilana Frenkel, one of the event's organizers. "The size of the horror is more than anyone can imagine. This is the beginning of explaining how horrible it was."Armed Israeli soldiers mill about. The scores of charred cars that were set afire during the attack have all been hauled away, and the burnt road is being repaved. But there are still a few mangled beach chairs and broken coolers lying in the surrounding fields and eucalyptus forest.The memorial event, held a couple of miles from the Gaza Strip, was hastily put together as the Israeli army only gave clearance a few days earlier. Five well-known Israeli DJs played music throughout the day, while pictures of the Oct. 7 attack victims were projected on screens.Asher Swissa, whose DJ name is Skazi, opened the event."This was not only a massacre of people," he says. "It was a massacre of music, of freedom, of something much more bigger than us."Swissa, a trance producer with a global following, was out of the country on Oct. 7. But he says it was extremely important to be here now for the memorial."I'd say I played many festivals in my life — including internationally. I've been all over the world. But I never felt what I feel here in this moment. I feel sadness," he says. "Deep sadness."Swissa says Israel is known the world over for its rave events and what's called psytrance, or psychedelic trance, music. The Nova rave party is held every year in different venues around Israel.Swissa hadn't been sure how he would open the tribute, but says he knew as soon as he got here."Based on a Hebrew poem The memorial rave lasted throughout the day, giving anyone who wished the opportunity to come.Thirty-one-year-old Bar Markos showed up with his twin brother, Dor. They were among the ravers who escaped on Oct. 7."This is holy ground for us," Bar Markos says. "We came back to close the circle."Markos says Hamas blocked the the road out on the day of the attack. The brothers escaped in their car on other dirt roads, and planned to leave the memorial the same way, to get some closure.He says this is the first time he's listened to music since the attack."And this is the first time I've been able to cry," he says. "The music is bringing it out."Joss Aviv, 24, another of the event's organizers, says from now on, there will always be the Israel that existed before Oct. 7 and the Israel after."This impacts everything," he says, "your trust, and your sense of security. This is the 9/11 of Israel. Everything is compromised. So we're in that shock and revival stage. We're not anywhere near drawing the conclusion or what are the next steps. But when we reach that point, we're going to have a lot to talk about. This impacts everything."Twenty-three-year-old Yarden Guez is here because she lost many friends at the rave concert. She says the Oct. 7 attack has changed the way she thinks about living together with the Palestinians."I used to be very hopeful about what could happen," she says. "I used to think about the future and how we could explain to them that we're trying to fight Hamas, but not them."But she now believes that's impossible.As for Markos, his wish is that Israel's close-knit rave community can start dancing together again.

content:U.S. food safety officials are urging consumers not to eat certain cantaloupe products, including some fruit cups, due to the risk of illness as they investigate a worsening outbreak of salmonella infections.The number of reported infections has nearly tripled in the two weeks since the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention At least 117 people in 34 states have gotten sick from the bacteria, the CDC said in The CDC advises against eating any cantaloupe or cantaloupe product that may have come from two brands — Malichita or Rudy. Whole cantaloupes from these brands might have stickers with the number "4050" and the phrase "Product of Mexico/produit du Mexique." Additionally, nine companies have recalled pre-cut cantaloupe products and other fruit medleys that may have used or touched Malichita or Rudy cantaloupes. Those companies include:In general, the CDC advises not to eat any pre-cut cantaloupe unless you're certain that Malchita or Rudy brands weren't used. "This includes cantaloupe chunks and fruit mixes with cantaloupes at restaurants and grocery stores" as well as items you might have bought last month and stored in your freezer, the CDC says. If you do find you purchased these products, health officials advise that you wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cantaloupe using hot, soapy water. People infected with salmonella usually experience diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, with symptoms beginning between six hours and six days after consuming the bacteria. Most people recover  four to seven days later. Children under 5 and seniors are at a higher risk of severe, sometimes fatal, illness. For this outbreak, at least 29% of those interviewed by the CDC were children under 5; 50% were 65 years or older. The true number of people made sick by this outbreak is "likely much higher than the number reported" because many people recover without medical care, the CDC says. Public health officials estimate that In addition to the cantaloupe-related outbreak, the CDC is currently investigating lesser outbreaks linked to

The search for the attackers soon turned into an investigation of Smollett himself, leading to his arrest on charges he had orchestrated the whole thing.Authorities said he paid two men whom he knew from work on "Empire," which filmed in Chicago. Prosecutors said Smollett told the men what slurs to shout, and to yell that he was in "MAGA Country," a reference to Donald Trump's presidential campaign slogan.A jury convicted Smollett in 2021 on five felony counts of disorderly conduct, a charge that can be filed in Illinois when a person lies to police.He now will have to finish A message seeking comment from his attorney, Nenye Uche, was not immediately returned. Lawyers for Smollett, who is Black and gay, have publicly claimed that he was the target of a racist justice system and people playing politics.Appellate Justice Freddrenna Lyle would have thrown out the convictions. She said it was "fundamentally unfair" to appoint "It was common sense that Smollett was bargaining for a complete resolution of the matter, not simply a temporary one," Lyle said.Special prosecutor Dan Webb was appointed to look into why the case was dropped. A grand jury subsequently Smollett was not immune to a fresh round of charges, appellate Justices David Navarro and Mary Ellen Coghlan said in the majority opinion."The record does not contain any evidence that (prosecutors) agreed Smollett would not be further prosecuted in exchange for forfeiting his bond and performing community service," they said.

content:I watched anxiously as my 80-pound doodle trotted off to his regularly scheduled doggy daycare, blissfully unaware that he'd soon be swapping all manner of germs with his buddies.I wondered, does this constitute a high-risk situation? This was the same small circle of dogs he played with every week, but I had no clue where the others spent their time.Would he come home with more than a healthy dose of slobber? Maybe, even, a new and Reports of respiratory illness afflicting dogs have put many dog owners like myself on edge in recent weeks.Social media is filled with increasingly distressing headlines and anecdotes of otherwise healthy pets coming down with a raft of symptoms, everything from a hacking cough to sometimes life-threatening complications.Most concerning, veterinarians say they're unable to identify what's making the dogs ill and the go-to treatments for canine respiratory illness, generally called "kennel cough," appear to be ineffective.The list of states with suspected cases of a "The uncertainty is worrying for theBut veterinarians who study infectious diseases say this may, in fact, not be an outbreak of a singular illness at all. There's still scant evidence connecting these cases with any common pathogen, let alone to an altogether new one."It's entirely possible that there are just a ton of different bugs and viruses causing disease in different parts of the country," says Because the U.S. doesn't have a robust surveillance system for infectious disease in dogs, it's hard to track these cases and discern whether anecdotes and scraps of data add up to widespread and concerning patterns."Two things keep getting mixed up," says Weese says it seems that certain parts of the country are experiencing an uptick in canine respiratory illness. However, it's possible the deluge of media coverage and attention on social media has created the appearance of a nationwide outbreak that may not exist in reality."I get an email a couple of times a week saying, 'hey, are we seeing more respiratory disease in dogs?" he says, "But I've been getting that email for like five years."Despite all the attention on individual cases, there's nothing at this point "that would indicate there's a national outbreak, anything that would indicate these are all medically connected to each other," says Dr. Silene St. Bernard, a regional medical director for VCA Animal Hospitals, which runs more than a thousand hospitals in the U.S. and Canada.Of course, none of this skepticism rules out the possibility that there is a new pathogen starting to spread.For example, researchers in New Hampshire have identified an odd bacteria that could be relevant, although they haven't yet confirmed this is actually what's causing illness in some dogs."The three choices are: There is not a new disease out there. There is a disease whose incidence is particularly high right now and it's a known agent," says While there's no official tally, there are now hundreds of cases of an "atypical canine respiratory disease," according to state health officials and medical organizations in more than a dozen states.However, Williams cautions this framing can give the impression that a clearly defined disease is spreading. "We have a very poor understanding of the cases clinically," he says.Generally speaking, the unifying symptom seems to be a persistent cough that doesn't resolve as would be expected with typical cases of kennel cough. In the worst cases, dogs can come down with severe pneumonia, which sometimes develops rapidly.Similar to veterinarians in other states, "We've been running respiratory panels to check about 20 different viruses and bacteria," says Beyer, who runs South Des Moines Veterinary Center, "A lot of them are coming back negative."This observation by veterinarians around the country has raised the specter of a new pathogen, but there's actually many reasons why the PCR tests used for canine respiratory illness could come back negative, says Sykes of UC Davis.The sample collected could simply be too small, or taken from the wrong part of the body; the levels of the pathogen can change from day to day, or the dog's body might have stopped shedding it by the time the sample was collected.Even if it's a well-known bug, the genetic sequence might be different enough that the PCR test fails to detect it."For some of these organisms, negative results are even more common than positive test results," she says.Sykes, who founded the International Society for Companion Animal Infectious Diseases, says the observations that dogs are resistant to standard treatment is thorny because many dogs are treated unnecessarily with antibiotics, when, in fact, they have a viral illness."What's actually being said here by veterinarians in these different locations is really that dogs are taking a long time to recover," she says.Of the many possibilities, she suspects one could be a "pathogen soup," essentially a mixture of co-occurring infections that are making dogs especially sick and prolonging their recovery.Respiratory disease in dogs wax and wane and the last few years have seen more "dramatic swings" where outbreaks last longer and take place across broader areas, says Dr. Weese.The epidemiology around this illness is especially hazy because there's already some mix of the usual suspects, like The uptick in illness doesn't happen in a vacuum, either: Dog ownership in the U.S has gone up steadily, vaccinations have been disrupted in recent years, and the holiday season has led more people to board their dogs or bring them on travel and mingle them with other pets.Still pathologists are keeping an open mind as they collect samples from sick dogs and search for clues.In New Hampshire, a team of researchers have While they haven't been able to culture the bacteria, they've identified it in samples collected from dogs who fell ill in New Hampshire last year and from dogs in neighboring states this year."We think this may be a pathogen," says Needle is analyzing samples from other states to see if they can find the same genetic material in sick dogs there.While intriguing, Weese points out that "We just don't know at this point," he says.In Oregon, Williams is skeptical that would explain what he's seeing in his state, saying it's possible something distinct is happening in the Pacific Northwest.In fact, he's in the early stages of examining the lungs of dogs who died from the atypical respiratory illness that For now though, veterinarians tell NPR it's wise for dog owners to take common-sense measures, like avoiding contact with sick dogs and making sure your dog is up to date on its vaccine.Ultimately, Weese says it will depend on your situation."If there are a lot of sick dogs in your area, then it is reasonable to be more restrictive. If you've got a dog that's at high risk for disease, be more restrictive," he says.Some people may want to steer clear of "high traffic" public places like dog parks and if possible, boarding facilities, groomers and other crowded settings, says "Those are the activities that if you're nervous about exposure, I would avoid because that's where dogs with many backgrounds, many immunization levels and things like that mix," she says.Nichols worries about the exponential rise in fear among some pet owners. She and her colleagues have noticed it's led some to skip routine health care, worried their dog might catch something at the clinic."I understand people's concerns. I think avoiding the vet clinic is not the way to go," she says.And if your pet does get sick, get them seen immediately. Ashley Dozier, a vet tech in Virginia Beach, initially wasn't too worried when her young golden retriever started coughing earlier this fall. That changed as his condition deteriorated, though."I brought him in to work and he was diagnosed with pneumonia," says Dozier. "He went a total of nine weeks on three different types of antibiotics and a round of about three to four weeks of steroids."Now off the steroids, she says he's finally starting to bounce back.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Is there a dog pandemic? There are reports about respiratory illnesses in dogs, although some veterinarians say there is no reason to panic. NPR's Will Stone reports.WILL STONE, BYLINE: About two months ago, Dr. Melissa Beyer noticed something unusual. Some of the dogs coming into her clinic, South Des Moines Veterinary Center, were sick. They had a hacking cough. She tried to treat them for a respiratory illness as she normally would, but it didn't seem to be helping.MELISSA BEYER: So that was kind of the red flag that something's going on here that was different. And since then, we've just seen more and more of those.STONE: She would run the standard tests that search for common bugs that make dogs sick, and they would come back negative.BEYER: Fortunately for us, kind of across the board, we don't have a lot of fatalities from it. It's just that they're taking longer to respond.STONE: Reports of a similar illness have emerged all over the country, starting last year when cases popped up in New Hampshire, then this summer, more hot spots in New England - next Oregon, Colorado. And now the list seems to grow by the day. The headlines and online chatter about a mysterious illness have alarmed many dog owners. But Dr. Jane Sykes says, hold on a minute.JANE SYKES: This, to me, is not anything super new. And I do worry that it's been blown up, potentially, through social media circulation.STONE: Sykes studies infectious diseases at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.SYKES: It's entirely possible that there is just a ton of different bugs and viruses that are causing disease in different parts of the country.STONE: Sykes says just because tests come back negative doesn't mean the dog has a never-seen-before disease. The samples can be too small or taken too late.SYKES: There's lots of reasons why you can get negative results. And in fact, for some of these organisms, negative results are even more common than positive test results.STONE: She says it's possible dogs are getting infected with several bugs all at once, making the illness drag on. Dr. Silene St. Bernard is with VCA, which runs more than a thousand animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada.SILENE ST BERNARD: What we don't have at this point is anything that would indicate there's a national outbreak, anything that would indicate these are all medically connected to each other.STONE: She says it's normal to see a seasonal uptick in respiratory cases as people travel and board their dogs. Dr. Scott Weese studies infectious diseases at the Ontario Veterinary College.SCOTT WEESE: With respiratory disease in dogs, we always see it waxing and waning. We'll see some places get a cluster of disease, rates go up for a little while.STONE: He says in the last few years, there does seem to be longer and larger regional outbreaks. Any number of bugs, like influenza, could be involved.WEESE: We're looking, we're paying attention. There might be something new. We're far from saying there's something new.STONE: One intriguing bit of evidence comes from researchers in New Hampshire. Through genetic sequencing, they found what looks like a new bacterium in some dogs that were sick. But Weese says it's not clear that's actually the cause.WEESE: We've seen this before. We find something and say, hey, that's new, it must be a big problem. Then we realize every dog's got it.STONE: In Oregon, Dr. Kurt Williams thinks something different may be happening to dogs in his state. Williams runs the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, where he's finding bleeding and acute injury in the small air sacs in the lungs.KURT WILLIAMS: I don't want to get out over my skis here, but I've looked at a lot of dog lungs in my career and these are a little bit different. And so it makes me think maybe there is something out there. Doesn't mean we need to lose our minds.STONE: He knows this uncertainty is hard for dog owners to stomach.WILLIAMS: I totally understand it. And yet I think we need to be patient and trust the process.STONE: It may be out of sight, but he says that process, this painstaking detective work, will eventually pay off.Will Stone, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD'S "SPEAKING GENTLY")

tile: Millions of seniors struggle to afford housing — and it's about to get a lot worse
topic type: National
written by: By Jennifer Ludden
date: 11/30/2023
content:A few decades ago, Leslie McIntire thought she was doing everything right for a comfortable life. She was a tax accountant in Washington, D.C., and co-owned a not-for-profit bookstore. "I had good savings," she says. "I was quite happy, quite frankly, and I was preparing to go back to school."Then a car accident dislocated her hip and jaw, left her psychologically rattled and derailed her career.McIntire held on in her rent-controlled apartment for a while, even after she was forced to go on disability and started burning through savings. She eventually realized she needed more help, but then had to endure a three-year wait to get into the federally subsidized senior housing where she now lives."And by the time I got in here, I was seriously considering going into a shelter," she says. "I paid my rent, my utilities. I had SNAP benefits for food. And I had $25 left over. And you just can't live on that in the long run."McIntire is 69, part of the baby boomer generation that is entering older age amid a historic affordable housing shortage and rising wealth inequality in the U.S. She wishes she'd known earlier how difficult things could get."I think that's the main thing people need to know," she says, "that they need to be prepared beforehand for what's coming down the road."A Nearly a third of households headed by seniors are considered cost burdened, which means they pay more than 30% of their income for housing.  Half of that group pays more than 50%. And as the boomers have aged, households in this group reached an all-time high of 11.2 million in 2021.  That's likely to grow further as the number of households headed by someone aged 80 and over doubles by 2040. "Their purchasing power is going down, at a time when rents are rising and other costs are rising, food and health care and all of that," says Jennifer Molinsky, project director of Harvard's Housing and Aging Society program.Even for many moderate income seniors, Molinsky says the dual burden of housing costs and caregiving needs will be too much.Here are some of the report's other findings:All this means the number of seniors who qualify for federal housing subsidies "is just growing and growing," says Molinsky, but there's not nearly enough of it to meet that demand. Unlike food assistance or Medicaid, public housing or rental vouchers are not an entitlement. "We're barely keeping up with serving a third" of seniors who qualify, she says, and "that other unserved number is just expanding all the time."The Harvard report also notes that more people over age 50 are losing housing for the first time, while another large group has been chronically unhoused and aged on the streets. That includes Washington, D.C., native Harry Robertson."I could never stay nowhere more than one day," says the 56 year old, explaining that he spent years bouncing between shelters, rehab and staying with friends and family, never wanting to impose for too long. "If they allowed me two days, that was a blessing, so — spent a lot of time outside."Robertson says he struggled with addiction, which caused rifts with his family and led Amtrak to fire him after 19 years as an equipment service technician. He's proud that he achieved lasting sobriety while caring for his mother before she died of cancer in 2019. Robertson also recently became one of the lucky few with a federal housing voucher, placed in an apartment near his current job by the nonprofit Miriam's Kitchen. But the whole process to get the subsidy took five long years."My mental state then was not good at all. ... I was crumbling," he says. "It shouldn't take that long to get someone housing."It can be hard to manage health problems without stable housing. Years on the street or in shelters also takes a heavy toll on mental and physical health, says Margot Kushel, who directs the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco. "When you talk about homelessness, 50 is the new 75," she says. In a sweeping "Increasingly, the story of homelessness among adults is going to be older adults living in poverty, who are spending what should be their retirement years in the streets," she says. To keep more seniors housed in coming years, Harvard researcher Molinsky says it needs to be easier for people to age in place if they prefer. Among other things, the report suggests government programs to finance safety upgrades like ramps for those who can't afford them.Molinsky says there should also be more options for seniors who want to move, and — like other affordable housing advocates — calls for zoning reforms to allow more apartment buildings in places long dominated by single family homes.  Without more help, the financial squeeze seniors face will force tough choices for many. "It really is driving people's choices about where they want to live," says Molinsky. "It's driving their prioritization of other things in their budget, like out of pocket health care and food."MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The U.S. is aging fast. In fact, the oldest baby boomers start turning 80 in a few years. And it is happening amid a historic shortage of affordable housing and high prices. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports on a new warning that many seniors will struggle to get the housing and the care they need.JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: A few decades ago, Leslie McIntire thought she was doing everything right for a comfortable life. She was a tax accountant in Washington, D.C., and co-owned a not-for-profit bookstore.LESLIE MCINTIRE: I had good savings. I was quite happy, quite frankly, and I was preparing to go back to school.LUDDEN: Then a car accident dislocated her hip, left her traumatized and derailed her career. She held on in her rent-controlled apartment for quite a while, but eventually, McIntire went on disability and burned through savings, waiting three years to get into the senior housing where she is now.MCINTIRE: And by the time I got in here, I was seriously considering going into a shelter. I paid my rent, my utilities. I had SNAP benefits for food. And I had $25 left over. And you just can't live on that in the long run.LUDDEN: McIntire is now 69 and grateful to pay only 30% of her income for rent. Unlike Medicaid and SNAP benefits for food, federal housing subsidies are not an entitlement program. Only about a third of seniors who qualify actually get them. That's left more than 11 million older adults burdened by housing costs - an all-time high, according to a report out today from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Lead author Jennifer Molinsky says that number will keep going up as boomers enter their 80s.JENNIFER MOLINSKY: Their purchasing power is going down at a time when rents are rising and other costs are rising - food and, you know, health care and all of that.LUDDEN: More people will have medical problems, which can be costly, but their income is likely fixed or going down. The report finds only 14% of older adults living alone could afford a daily visit from a home health aide. Only 13% could move to assisted living without dipping into their assets. Two other trends spell trouble ahead. Since the 2008 housing crash, the homeownership rate for people in midlife is down significantly, and that could leave many of them cash-strapped later on because they have to rent. At the same time, there's been a jump in the share of older people who still owe money on their mortgage, even into their 80s.MOLINSKY: People who have mortgages are so much more likely to face affordability challenges.LUDDEN: Molinsky says there just aren't nearly enough places that are safe, convenient and affordable for people to live as they age.MOLINSKY: You not only need affordable housing. You may also need accessible housing, and you may need to have it located near transportation because you no longer drive or near your existing social and service network, which is really important.LUDDEN: The Harvard report also notes that people 50 and older now make up a growing share of the homeless population. That includes Harry Robertson, a Washington, D.C., native who spent years bouncing between shelters, rehab, friends and family, never wanting to impose for too long.HARRY ROBERTSON: I could never stay nowhere more than one day. If they allowed me two days, that was a blessing. So I spent a lot of time outside.LUDDEN: Robertson is 56 and proud that he finally became sober while caring for his mother before she died. This year he also got a federal housing voucher, but that process took five long years.ROBERTSON: My mental state then was not good at all. You know, I was crumbling. It shouldn't take that long to get someone housing.LUDDEN: Margot Kushel of UC San Francisco says more people over 50 are also losing housing for the first time. Often, it's those who've had low-wage, physically demanding jobs without a pension or strong health care.MARGOT KUSHEL: Increasingly, the story of homelessness among adults is going to be older adults living in poverty who are spending what should be their retirement years in the streets.LUDDEN: So what to do about all of this? Harvard researcher Molinsky wants zoning changes to build more senior-friendly apartments and more help for older people to retrofit their own homes to age in place safely. Leslie McIntire, the woman who worried she'd end up in a shelter, has her own advice.MCINTIRE: The main thing people need to know is that they need to be prepared beforehand for what's coming down the road.LUDDEN: Because you never know, she says, when bad things might happen.

tile: Countries promise millions for damages from climate change. So how would that work?
topic type: Climate
written by: By Lauren Sommer
date: 12/01/2023
content:As climate change negotiations kicked off in Dubai, countries reached a historic agreement for a new fund to help developing countries which bear the brunt of climate impacts.More than $400 million was announced, with the largest pledges coming from Germany and the United Arab Emirates, to kick off the "loss and damage" fund. They are the first pledges since the fund was created The idea is to aid developing countries that are already dealing with devastating impacts, like hurricanes, droughts and floods. But the initial funding is a tiny fraction of the overall need. A Before the fund can make a difference on the ground, countries still have a number of issues to sort out, including which countries will pay into it and which countries will receive funding."Pledges should be commensurate with the scale of the needs for loss and damage, which is already costing hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars a year," said Angela Rivera, speaking for Colombia at the COP28 summit. "We need to scale up quickly to make up for 30 years of lost time."Here's the need that one country is facing: the small island nation of Antigua and Barbuda.Like many Caribbean islands, it's extremely vulnerable to hurricanes that are becoming more destructive as the climate warms. In 2017, a massive category 5 storm, Hurricane Irma, hit the islands. The storm's size was larger than the islands themselves and left widespread destruction in its wake."You just have to replace every single thing," says Diann Black-Layne, climate change ambassador for Antigua and Barbuda. "The homes are damaged, and there's no place to go. And the whole island gets hit - the entire population is affected."The cost of rebuilding has been challenging, she says. And rebuilding does not take into account preparing the country for the next storm. The island's homes and buildings are mainly built to withstand category 2 hurricanes. Upgrading them to withstand stronger storms, by adding features like wind-resistant roofs, just adds to the cost.On top of that, rising sea levels are threatening coastal development, which means residents will need to be relocated. That also threatens their fresh water supply, as saltwater creeps inland. Dealing with and preparing for the impacts of climate change will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Black-Layne says."We are looking at 2 or 300 percent of our national GDP just to get ready," she says. "Our way of life and our ability to live here, our ability to even have an economy is threatened."For years, developing countries have sought compensation for the damages caused by climate change. Cumulatively, the U.S. and Europe are responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions going back to the Industrial Revolution. Developing countries are bearing the brunt of the impacts, having contributed little to climate change."This climate problem was caused by the industrialization of rich countries," says Avinash Persaud, special climate envoy for Barbados. "It is, in fact, how they got rich. And so they do need to show recognition and some responsibility in helping to finance the reconstruction and rehabilitation costs of climate impacts."A dedicated fund for loss and damage would be used to After a series of tense meetings over the last year, countries agreed to base the fund at the World Bank temporarily for four years. Some developing countries raised concerns that would burden them with high fees and too much influence from richer nations. As a result, developing countries will have equal representation on the board that controls the fund.The initial contributions will mainly get the fund up and running. Germany and the United Arab Emirates both announced $100 million. The United Kingdom announced 60 million pounds and Japan announced $10 million. The European Union The United States announced $17.5 million as well. The Biden Administration generally faces opposition from Republicans in Congress over international climate spending.Going forward, hundreds of billions of dollars will be needed annually. There's still debate over which countries will contribute as well. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses currently, has not committed any funding, though some developed countries are pushing for it to contribute to the fund."We expect it will draw from a wide variety of sources," Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry said at the COP28 talks. "The scale of the challenge is simply too large for any government to be able to finance alone."Richer countries are

content:At a gathering this fall in Singapore, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry took a moment to assure his audience that the U.S. is taking climate change seriously."I'm happy to report that the United States has stepped up under President Biden's leadership," Kerry told the crowd at the Kerry often points to landmark climate legislation passed last year, But many nations and climate advocates aren't impressed."There's just a trust deficit, in particular, with the U.S.," says Nisha Krishnan, climate director for the World Resources Institute's Africa office in Nairobi.The U.S. has a mixed record when it comes to international climate negotiations. Historically, the U.S. is responsible for emitting more planet-warming greenhouse gasses than any other nation. And while U.S. emissions are falling, it remains a major polluter, emitting more each year than any country but China.It's also sometimes a roadblock at negotiations. Former President Trump even But for those reasons the U.S. is also indispensable in addressing climate change, especially when it's working with China.Speaking in September at a "Humanity has opened the gates of hell," Guterres said. "Many of the poorest nations have every right to be angry. Angry that they are suffering most from a climate crisis they did nothing to create."Much of that anger comes down to money. Rich countries have promised to pay "Even delivering on one of these promises for the U.S. would really, I think, help bolster its reputation," says Krishnan.This year's climate talks have made some progress. On the first day of the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, The host nation, the United Arab Emirates, committed $100 million to the fund, as did Germany. The United States pledged to work with Congress to commit $17.5 million.But even as countries are frustrated with the U.S. for failing to live up to its commitments, there's an understanding that it remains essential to major breakthroughs."The Paris Agreement, for example, it really did take Obama to do all the backchannel diplomacy with China to be able to bring China to that table," says Naveeda Khan, chair of the Department of Anthropology at Johns Hopkins University. She recently Ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Obama administrationAs the world's two biggest economies and largest greenhouse gas emitters, international climate progress often depends on U.S. outreach to China, says Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute."This relationship is a tone-setting relationship," Li says.That relationship went into hibernation during the Trump administration and has been rocky under Biden, Li says. But this summer, it was rekindled, at least on climate issues. Earlier this month, climate envoys for both countries met in California, where they committed to a goal of tripling the deployment of renewable energy globally by 2030."The Nobody expects something on the scale of the Paris Agreement in Dubai. The negotiators could adopt the same commitment to triple renewable energy capacity and make more progress on climate finance issues. That may be enough to call it a success, considering the other geopolitical challenges in the world now, such as the wars in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas.But many people from developing nations want more."It's just high time that the United States has to come to terms with its role in global warming," says Denise Fontanilla, International Program Director at Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities in the Philippines.So far, U.S. efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions Fontanilla isn't expecting much from this climate summit."I certainly hope that the US will surprise me and the other people watching the negotiations," she says. "I would love to be proven wrong."

tile: Veterans fear the VA's new foreclosure rescue plan won't help them
topic type: Investigations
written by: By Chris Arnold, Quil Lawrence
date: 12/01/2023
content:While Ed O'Connor was in the hospital losing his leg, loan servicers were telling him he might be losing his house too.O'Connor is a 69-year-old Marine Corps veteran. Last year doctors amputated his right leg — a complication, he believes, of a blood infection he picked up serving in the Philippines. While he was recovering from the surgery, scary letters were arriving at home."They were going to do a foreclosure on me," he said. "Being in and out of the hospital, I'm talking on the phone, calling people up. You know, it's hard."Following an O'Connor is among tens of thousands of veterans who took what's called a COVID forbearance on a VA home loan — in his case because his wife lost her job during the pandemic. That allowed him to defer paying the mortgage and keep his home. Like many vets, he says he was promised he could resume normal payments after six to 18 months when the hardship was over, and simply add the missed payments to the end of the mortgage."Add the payments to the end of your mortgage ... your rate won't increase, the payments remain the same," is how O'Connor says it was described to him. "And I said, man, this would be a great relief."That's not what happened though. Instead, in October of 2022, the VA ended the part of its forbearance program that allowed missed payments to be moved to the back of the loan term. And that suddenly stranded veterans who were still on a forbearance, leaving them with no affordable way to get current on their loans and resume normal payments.O'Connor says he was told he needed to pay back more than $32,000 in a lump sum to catch up."I don't have $32,000!" O'Connor told NPR, as he sat in his new wheelchair at home in Fredericksburg, Va.After the NPR investigation last month revealed that thousands of veterans were in this same situation, four U.S. senators fired off But O'Connor's troubles don't seem to be over, because the VA's rescue plan may exclude many vets who already took what they considered to be their only option to save their homes.O'Connor is one of an untold number of veterans who ended up with much higher mortgage payments because they were pushed into loan modifications. Those modifications rolled the missed payments back into the mortgage — but with a new loan that had to be at current interest rates, which are about double what they were just two years ago."So they upped my mortgage rate," O'Connor said. "And I'm kind of like, wait a minute, you guys are really screwing me here.""When I got the home, I was only paying $1,750. Now I'm paying $2,400," he said.O'Connor said he's had to adjust his lifestyle to make the new mortgage payment."I make the car payment late, maybe two credit bills late, you know, we don't go to the store that often," says O'Connor, who is trying to stretch his disability check from the VA plus his wife's pay from a part-time job at a shopping mall. He feels betrayed by a program that was meant to help him."You know, they give you promises and then they give you an empty cup. I'm just kind of disgusted with it all."NPR has heard from veterans across the country, from Hawaii to Florida to New York, who all say they, too, are stuck with a much more costly mortgage."It doesn't seem quite fair to me," said U.S. Rep. Mark Takano, the leading Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, in an interview with NPR. "We've got to keep an eye on this."VA officials say they don't know how many veterans have been pushed into a loan modification that dramatically raised their payments.But this week at a press conference, NPR asked VA Secretary Denis McDonough about vets in this situation, and he urged them to "There may be bigger policy fixes later, but we want them to be in touch with us now," McDonough said. "We're also concerned obviously to hear that some of our vets feel that they've been misled. So we're looking into that."Former Marine Joe Mena feels misled.Mena joined the Marines in 2007 and deployed to Iraq. He served eight years, came home to start a family, then joined the National Guard in time to get called up during the pandemic. After he lost his regular job, he heard about the VA's mortgage forbearance."I thought that was, honestly, the coolest thing in the world," says Mena.Mena says he was told the same thing other veterans recall: Just defer paying, and those missed payments would get shifted to the back end of his 30-year mortgage."I was like, I don't mind having a 31-year mortgage, that's fine," he said. "I'm gonna be living in this house forever."But in September he was told by his mortgage company that the deal had changed."They sent me a statement that said that forbearance is up," Mena said. And if he wanted to avoid foreclosure he had to pay $57,000 for the missed payments, or he could do a loan modification.Mena says he didn't have $57,000. So he says the company placed him into a loan modification that he can't afford. It pushes up his monthly payments by $1,300 per month, to $3,600.His first payment is due today, Dec. 1. He's working, again as a certified nursing assistant, but he has no idea how he'll be able to keep up with such a big payment.Mena said he reached out to the VA and others but he's not sure what to do. The stress is a serious issue for him. Mena lost a good friend in a particularly bad way in Iraq and it still haunts him. He's in therapy twice a week for post-traumatic stress."I suffer from suicidal ideation constantly. So this is one of the times, this is a type of trigger that would put me in an inpatient facility," he said.Mena grew up with four siblings, and a single mom who did her best — but they did get evicted from apartments sometimes. This is the first time he's owned a house.He's exactly who the VA home loan has been intended to help "My one goal is to have a house for my kids," he says. "I'm trying to keep it all together for the kids that I love and my wife that I love very much. But I'm not together at all."I wasn't together before I found out about this. And now it's ... I'm losing it," he says.Mena has three kids and a baby on the way in March. He has no idea if this new program the VA is rolling out is going to help him.Adding to his confusion, his paperwork appears to show that he is in a trial period for the loan modification. He'd like to back out, and wait for the VA's new rescue plan, but he doesn't know if he can.Mena's mortgage company, LoanCare, declined to discuss his situation and said in a brief statement to NPR that the company "complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and agency guidelines" for mortgages.Meanwhile, for the 40,000 homeowners with VA loans who did not get into loan modifications yet, and are currently in the foreclosure process or delinquent, the VA this week released At his press conference, VA Secretary McDonough said his agency has met with companies servicing more than 90% of all VA loans, and that they will comply."This will pause the foreclosure process for these veterans through May 31 next year, 2024, giving us the additional time that we need to help these veterans find solutions to stay in their homes," he said.Still, as of earlier this week that message did not appear to be trickling down to all the people working at mortgage companies."I received a call yesterday, come to find out we're officially in the first day of the foreclosure process," Marine Corps veteran Jason Miles told NPR.Miles served in the Marines for a decade starting in 2003. He did four tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.He lost a sales job during the pandemic and had to take a forbearance. These days he's a teacher and a coach at Clinton Christian Academy, a high school in Clinton, Miss.Miles spoke to NPR from the school's athletic office. He has three kids. His oldest daughter is on a poster for the school volleyball team that's hung on the wall behind his desk."I know every dad brags on their kids," he says, clearly proud of her.But the past few months he's been keeping from the kids that the family doesn't have any affordable way to get caught up on about $20,000 of missed mortgage payments."This is horrifying," he said. "I'm scared to death that we're about to lose our home."Miles told the mortgage company, called Mr. Cooper, that he'd read reports that the VA is pausing foreclosures so families like his could get help. He said the company representative still told him "you have to pay the full amount back or you're going into foreclosure."After the VA issued its official guidance on Thursday Mr. Cooper said in a statement to NPR, "We are taking immediate steps based on this guidance and look forward to expanded options to support Veterans exiting their pandemic forbearance plans."The VA said it is encouraging all veterans who are struggling with their mortgage, whether they're in a loan modification already or not, to contact the VA at 1-877-827-3702 or visit LEILA FADEL, HOST:  After an NPR investigation, the Department of Veterans Affairs has halted foreclosures for thousands of veterans who were about to lose their homes through no fault of their own. But it turns out there's another whole layer, people who were pushed into loan modifications they can't afford. It's not clear what the VA is going to do to help them, as NPR's Chris Arnold and Quil Lawrence report.CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: When the VA halted foreclosures last week, that was a big relief to thousands of veterans who were on the verge of losing their homes. But it might be too little, too late for people like Edward O'Connor.EDWARD O'CONNOR: You know, they give you promises and then they give you, you know, an empty cup, you know? I'm just kind of disgusted with it all.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: O'Connor is 69 years old. He volunteered for the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. He bought a house in Virginia in 2019 with a loan backed by the VA.ARNOLD: But when COVID hit, his wife lost her job. And they were going to miss a mortgage payment. Their mortgage company told them, though, that that was OK. They could do what's called a COVID forbearance.O'CONNOR: She said, well, you know, you sign this, you send it back. We add the payments to the end of your mortgage, blah, blah, blah. You know, your rate wont increase. Your payments remain the same. I said, man, this would be a great relief.LAWRENCE: But that's not how it worked because a year ago, the VA ended a program that provided the only path for veterans to get current on their loans again and keep their same low-interest rate and mortgage payment.ARNOLD: When the VA ended that program, that stranded thousands of veterans who were still on a forbearance plan with no affordable way to get current on their loans. O'Connor says he was told that he had to come up with upwards of $32,000 to get caught up.O'CONNOR: They were going to do a foreclosure on me because they said I had to pay this amount of money. I don't have $32,000.LAWRENCE: While this was happening, O'Connor was actually in the hospital getting his leg amputated due to a blood infection he says he got while serving in the Philippines.O'CONNOR: Being in and out of the hospital, I mean, I'm talking on the phone, calling people up. You know, it's hard because you're asking for information - it's home with the house. I don't have it with me. I mean, it's just - it was crazy.LAWRENCE: We talked to him on a Zoom call. He was wheeling around his house in his new wheelchair. After NPR first reported on thousands of veterans in this situation, the VA halted foreclosures for six months.ARNOLD: But this is where that whole other layer of complication comes in. It's looking too late for people like O'Connor because in order to avoid foreclosure, O'Connor says he's already been pushed into a loan modification at today's much higher interest rates. They're over 7%.O'CONNOR: So they up my mortgage rate. So I'm kind of like, wait a minute. You guys are really screwing me here. Beginning, when I got to home, I was only paying 1,750. You know, now I'm paying 2,400.LAWRENCE: O'Connor says it's hard for him and his wife to afford much besides food and keeping the lights on.O'CONNOR: Like, I make the car payment late, maybe two credit bills late. We don't go to the store that often.ARNOLD: NPR has heard from veterans from Hawaii to Florida to New York who are all telling pretty much the same story.MARK DULAC: I can't pay you 4 grand a month of the money I really don't have. And it's Christmas, for God's sake.KAREN WHITLEY: I feel like I've been hoodwinked. I feel like I've been scammed almost.JOE MENA: So, like, I'll have a house, but I won't have lights, I won't have gas, I won't have food for my kids.ARNOLD: Those were Air Force vet Mark Dulac (ph), Navy vet Karen Whitley (ph) and Marine Joe Mena.LAWRENCE: VA officials say they don't know how many veterans have been pushed into a loan modification that jacked up their payments. This week at a press conference, we asked VA Secretary Denis McDonough, what about them?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ARNOLD: Might there be a way to help some of these people who are not, like, right now on the verge of foreclosure, but they ended up in a really bad place, and it wasn't the deal that they were promised?DENIS MCDONOUGH: For those veterans in a situation like the one you talked about, Chris, we are here now to help. There may be bigger policy fixes later, but we want them to be in touch with us now. We're also concerned, obviously, to hear that some of our vets feel that they've been misled, so we're looking into that.ARNOLD: Former Marine Joe Mena, who we heard earlier saying it's hard to afford food for his kids - he certainly feels misled.LAWRENCE: Mena joined the Marines in 2007 when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were raging. He served three deployments and then came home to start a family. He lost work during the pandemic, then heard about forbearance.MENA: I thought that was, honestly, the coolest thing in the world.ARNOLD: He was told the same thing as others, just defer paying and those missed payments would get shifted to the back end of his 30-year mortgage.MENA: I was like, I don't mind having a 31-year mortgage. That's fine. Like, I'm going to be living in this house forever.LAWRENCE: But putting the missed payments to the back - that didn't happen.MENA: September of this year, they sent me a statement that said that forbearance is up. You're now in foreclosure.ARNOLD: He says he was told he either had to come up with $57,000 to catch up, which he doesn't have, or do a loan modification. He says his first payment is actually due today, and it's gone up by more than $1,300 a month.LAWRENCE: Mena lost a buddy in a particularly bad way in Iraq, and it still haunts him. He's in therapy twice a week for post-traumatic stress.MENA: I suffer from suicidal ideation constantly. So this is one of those times that - this is a type of trigger that would put me in an inpatient facility.LAWRENCE: Mena says he grew up with four siblings and a single mom, who did her best, but they got evicted from apartments sometimes. This is the first time he's owned a house. And he's exactly who the VA home loan has been for since World War II, veterans who need a leg up into the middle class to help them become homeowners, offer them that stability.MENA: My one goal is to have a house for my kids. I'm trying to keep it all together for the kids that I love and my wife that I love very much, but I'm not together at all.ARNOLD: Mena has no idea if this new program the VA is rolling out is going to help him, since he's already been pushed into this new loan modification that he says he can't afford.LAWRENCE: Mena says he's reached out to VA to ask what he should do next, and he's waiting to hear what they say. VA Secretary Denis McDonough told us, anybody who's stuck in a similar situation should be doing just that. Reach out to them at va.gov/housing-assistance.Quil Lawrence.ARNOLD: Chris Arnold, NPR News.FADEL: If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the suicide and crisis lifeline.(SOUNDBITE OF YEHEZKEL RAZ'S "BALLERINA")

tile: For years, the FBI quietly stopped tracking anti-Arab violence and hate crimes
topic type: National
written by: By Odette Yousef
date: 12/01/2023
content:The families of three college students of Palestinian descent who were shot over the weekend in Vermont are calling it a crime "Still, the shooting surfaces long-standing issues in tracking possible hate crimes committed against Arab Americans. And the question of whether this attack will ultimately be prosecuted as a hate crime is set against an unique and complex history when it comes to tracking anti-Arab violence in the U.S.According to police, the men were speaking a mix of Arabic and English and two of them were wearing Palestinian keffiyah scarves when they were accosted on a residential street in Burlington. But the Those "statements or remarks" can be important evidence when determining whether or not the case is categorized as a hate crime. "Although we do not yet have evidence to support a hate crime enhancement, I do want to be clear that there is no question that this was a hateful act," said Chittenden County State's Attorney Sarah George during a press conference on Monday. Nonetheless, the men's families are pushing to have the attack prosecuted as a hate crime. One of the victims, Kinnan Abdelhamid, was released from the hospital on Monday. In a For nearly two decades, anti-Arab violence was omitted from hate crime data.When the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program developed its NPR reached out to the FBI, but did not receive a response."The Anti-Arab category is, frankly, a newer one," said Maya Berry, executive director of the AAI. "And it creates a very real challenge in the problem of getting accurate data about us that way."According to an "So we were literally rendered invisible in the hate crime data for decades," said Berry. The omission of the category meant that even during periods when it was known that anti-Arab sentiment was high, such as during the period after the 9/11 attacks, there was no measurement of the scale of the backlash. Berry said it also carried troubling implications for whether law enforcement was sensitized to anti-Arab bias."It also impacts the training that local law enforcement is going to receive about how to engage in local communities," she said. "If it's not part of the law enforcement training that they're receiving they may not be able to correctly identify a potential hate crime."Bias Code 31 was finally introduced back into the national reports in 2015, following a horrific attack at a Sikh house of worship. In 2012, a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisc., killing six people. The incident prompted several organizations to push for a broadening of bias motivation categories in the UCR system. Along with the anti-Arab Bias Code 31, codes were also added to document anti-Mormon, anti-Jehovah's Witness, anti-Eastern Orthodox, anti-Other Christian, Anti-Buddhist, anti-Hindu and anti-Sikh crimes.But even with the reintroduction of the anti-Arab hate crime category, many believe there continues to be a severe underreporting of incidents. In "Anti-Muslim hate crimes pose a real difficulty because of an attenuated relationship with law enforcement, with immigration authorities, language barriers among other things," said Brian Levin, former founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Levin said that post-9/11 surveillance programs undermined the trust that Arab and Muslim communities otherwise might have built with local and federal law enforcement. "So I really think when we're looking at this, we have to remember that there are certain communities where underreporting, I believe, is far more rampant than in other communities," he said.

content:Phillip Hancock on Thursday became the fourth death row inmate Nationally, executions climbed for the second year in a row in 2023, with Texas and Florida accounting for more than half, according to Twenty-four people have been put to death so far in 2023, up from 18 in 2022 and 11 in 2021. The center found that the increase can be attributed to Florida's return to executions after a three-year pause "as [Gov. Ron DeSantis] launched a presidential campaign."As NPR Meanwhile, Texas continued its streak as the nation's busiest capital punishment state, conducting eight executions this year.The remaining court-ordered deaths were limited to three states: Alabama, which killed two inmates after But despite the uptick in state-sanctioned deaths, a majority of the public is turning against executions. For the first time since it began surveying Americans on the death penalty in 2000, a "The data show that most Americans no longer believe the death penalty can be imposed fairly," Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), said in a statement.The DPIC reports that given those shifting attitudes, as well as changes in the law and prosecutorial decision-making, most of the prisoners who were executed over the last 11 months "would likely not have been sentenced to death if tried today." Instead, the prisoners would likely receive life sentences because contemporary juries are typically presented with comprehensive biographical and psychologicalThe study found that jurors now hear much more evidence of a defendant's mental illness, developmental impairments, and severe trauma during court proceedings, and therefore, are more likely to consider their effects before imposing the ultimate punishment. According to data analyzed by the DPIC, 79% of the death row inmates executed in 2023 had some disability or impairment, including serious mental illness, brain injury, developmental brain damage, or an IQ in the range considered intellectually disabled; and/or chronic serious childhood trauma, neglect and/or abuse. The report adds: "One-third or eight of the people executed had all three. At least three prisoners were under the age of 20 at the time of their crimes."DPIC's Maher said the changing attitudes toward the death penalty also extend to conservative lawmakers and elected officials who, in recent years, have expressed "an unprecedented show of support for death-sentenced prisoners" moving some to "oppose use of the death penalty in their state."   That is evident in Oklahoma, where Republican Attorney General Gentner Drummond and a bipartisan group of 62 Oklahoma lawmakers — 45 of whom are also Republicans — are calling for the courts to vacate the conviction In 1997, Justin Sneed, a handyman at an Oklahoma City motel killed his boss, Barry Van Treese, with a baseball bat during a robbery attempt. Sneed was soon captured and admitted to the murder. When the case went to trial, Sneed claimed that Glossip promised to pay him $10,000 in a murder-for-hire plot. Sneed's testimony was the Glossip's first conviction was overturned on appeal due to ineffective counsel. In 2004, a second jury also found him guilty, issuing the death penalty. But questions about Sneed's testimony and the absence of evidence against Glossip have undermined the legitimacy of the death sentence, leading to four stays and two independent investigations. One of those All of that has prompted the state attorney general to intercede on Glossip's behalf. "While the State has previously opposed relief for Glossip, it has changed its position based on a careful review of the new information that has come to light," The evidence has also moved Oklahoma state Rep. Kevin McDugle, a Republican,He added: "I am good with the death penalty as long as we have a pure process all the way through, and we can say for sure, for certain, that we're executing guilty people. But if we have any ability for someone to get through there and be an innocent person, then I will fight against the death penalty here." The DPIC's latest report notes that cases like these, combined with instances in which death row inmates are exonerated after decades of maintaining their innocence, raise new concerns about the fairness and accuracy of the death penalty itself.Another factor moving some lawmakers to enact moratoriums or pauses on executions is the continued difficulties states face in obtaining lethal injection drugs. As of now, 29 states have either

It's that sincere belief in the possibility of goodness that draws me back to Miyazaki's work again and again — and that makes TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. Ten years ago, the revered Japanese director and animator Hayao Miyazaki announced his retirement. Now at the age of 82, Miyazaki has returned with a new animated feature called "The Boy And The Heron." Our film critic Justin Chang says it's a gorgeously drawn and deeply moving work from an undisputed master of storytelling.JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Those of us who love the work of the anime master Hayao Miyazaki have happily learned not to take his retirement announcements too seriously. In 1997, he claimed that "Princess Mononoke" would be his final animated feature. In 2001, he said the same about his future Oscar winner, "Spirited Away." Still, there was a greater air of finality in 2013 around "The Wind Rises," a mournful drama of love and loss that felt like a fitting swansong. But Miyazaki clearly had more to say. A decade after "The Wind Rises," he returns with "The Boy And The Heron," which combines the excitement of a child's grand adventure and the weight of an older man's reflection.The boy of the title is 12-year-old Mahito, whom we first meet on a fateful night in 1943. Bombs are falling on Tokyo, and his mother dies tragically in a fire at a hospital. A year later, a still grieving Mahito moves to the countryside with his father who's about to marry a woman named Natsuko. Some, but not all, of this is drawn from Miyazaki's own life. While his parents both survived the war and lived for decades afterward, Miyazaki has spoken of his memories of fleeing Tokyo during the war when he was just a child. His father ran a company that manufactured airplane parts, a backstory that Mahito's father shares, as well. But that's about as close to reality as the movie gets.If this is a partial self-portrait, it's also a beguiling fantasy in which Miyazaki's flair for wondrous characters, bewildering plot turns and gorgeous and grotesque imagery is on inventive display. As he explores his new home, Mahito gets to know his stepmother-to-be and a gaggle of gossipy grannies who help look after him and the house. In time, he also crosses paths with a mysterious, grey heron that keeps trying to get his attention, at one point poking its head in through his bedroom window. "Your presence is requested," it says. The heron is voiced by Robert Pattinson in the English dubbed version, which also features actors including Christian Bale, Gemma Chan and Florence Pugh. If you can, though, I recommend seeking out the subtitled Japanese language version. Better yet, see them both. Miyazaki's story is too rich and strange to be digested in a single viewing.In one of those bizarre transformations all too common in the filmmaker's work, the heron soon reveals itself to be a man in avian disguise. He becomes a prickly companion of sorts to Mahito as they journey into an otherworldly realm that could be located at the center of the Earth or perhaps just at the core of Miyazaki's subconscious. At one point, Mahito meets a girl whom he gradually realizes is a younger version of his mother. He comes across a group of smiling, floating, little puffballs known as warawara who are so adorable that they made my 7-year-old daughter squeal in delight. Along the way, he's pursued by a menacing army of giant, green parakeets. If there's one ground rule in "The Boy And The Heron," it's that birds are clearly not to be trusted. I confess that I found much of this mystifying when I first saw it and that I couldn't have minded less. Miyazaki has never been bound by narrative logic, and his imagery here exerts its own hypnotic, hallucinatory pull.But there's a clue to the movie's meaning in its original Japanese language title, "How Do You Live?" It shares that title with the famous 1937 coming-of-age novel by Genzaburo Yoshino, a copy of which surfaces in the story as a gift to Mahito from his late mother. The question how do you live is one that Mahito must confront as he deals with wartime trauma and loss and also as he forges a bond with his future stepmother. But Miyazaki is also asking us how we live, how we push past our own despair and find balance in the instability of life. Over the years, his movies have provided their own hopeful answers. Set in worlds ravaged by greed, conflict and environmental destruction, they remind us that there's redemption in acts of kindness and love. It's that sincere belief in the possibility of goodness that draws me back to Miyazaki's work again and again and that makes "The Boy And The Heron" such a powerfully affecting addition to his legacy.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MOSLEY: Justin Chang is the film critic for the LA Times.
